  Welcome to Opus 4.6

❯ What plants do I currently have in my backyard? And what are the          
  conditions like back there?                                               

● I'll use the garden profile skill to look up your backyard plants and
  conditions.

  records:

  Backyard Plants

  Right now you have one established plant back there:

  - Large oak tree — on the north side of the yard. The species is unknown, but
  it's large and well-established. It dominates the north half of the space.

  That's it so far! Your Duke blueberries (planted Feb 10) are in the side yard
  along the fence, not the backyard.

  Backyard Conditions

  Your backyard is about 2,000 sq ft with two distinct zones:

  ┌───────────────────────┬─────────────────────┬──────────────────────────────┐
  │         Zone          │         Sun         │           Good For           │
  ├───────────────────────┼─────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────┤
  │ South half (~1,000 sq │ Full sun (6+ hrs)   │ Vegetables, raised beds,     │
  │  ft)                  │                     │ sun-loving perennials        │
  ├───────────────────────┼─────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────┤
  │ North half (~1,000 sq │ Partial to full     │ Shade perennials, ferns,     │
  │  ft, under oak)       │ shade (2–4 hrs)     │ hostas, groundcover          │
  ├───────────────────────┼─────────────────────┼──────────────────────────────┤
  │ Drip line (edge of    │ Dappled sun (4–5    │ Transition plantings, native │
  │ canopy)               │ hrs)                │  shrubs                      │
  └───────────────────────┴─────────────────────┴──────────────────────────────┘

  A few things are still unknown or unassessed:
  - Soil hasn't been tested yet (note: soil under the oak is likely more acidic
  and root-dense)
  - Irrigation hasn't been assessed yet
  - Portland-area soils are typically clay-heavy with acidic pH (5.5–6.5)

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Your backyard's dual sun/shade zones are a real asset — it's essentially two
  gardens in one. The sunny south half is prime real estate for a vegetable
  garden or pollinator beds, while the shaded north half under the oak is
  perfect for a Pacific Northwest woodland garden (think native sword ferns,
  Oregon grape, or wild ginger). A soil test this spring would be the single
  most valuable next step — it tells you pH and nutrient levels so you can amend
   correctly before planting anything new.

  Would you like suggestions for what to plant back there, or want to record
  anything new?
