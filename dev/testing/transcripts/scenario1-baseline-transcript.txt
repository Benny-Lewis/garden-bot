  Welcome to Opus 4.6

❯   I just moved into a new house in Portland, Oregon (zone 8b). I have a   
  south-facing front yard (~800 sq ft) and a                                
     larger backyard (~2000 sq ft) with a big oak tree that shades the      
  north half. Help me set up tracking for my                                
    garden so I can manage everything.                                      

● Let me check what's already in your project directory and then we'll set up a
  great garden tracking system for you.

● Searched for 1 pattern, read 1 file (ctrl+o to expand)

● Starting from a clean slate — perfect. Let me design and build out a garden
  tracking system for you.

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Portland Zone 8b Gardening Context:
  - USDA Zone 8b means minimum winter temps of 15-20°F — this opens up a wide
  range of plants including many evergreens, Mediterranean herbs, and PNW
  natives
  - South-facing front yard = full sun (6+ hours), great for vegetables, roses,
  lavender
  - Oak tree shade in the backyard creates two distinct microclimates — the
  shaded north half is ideal for hostas, ferns, and shade-loving natives
  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Let me set up the structure:

● Bash(mkdir -p "C:/Users/blewis/dev/landscaping-gardening/zones"
      "C:/Users/blewis/dev/landscaping-gardening/logs"
      "C:/Users/blewis/dev/landscaping-gardening/plans")
  ⎿  Done

      3 ## Setup
      4 
      5 - Created garden tracking system
      6 - Defined three zones:
      7   - **Zone A**: Front yard (~800 ft², full sun, south-facing)
      8   - **Zone B**: Backyard south half (~1000 ft², part sun)
      9   - **Zone C**: Backyard north half (~1000 ft², shade under oak)

● Your garden tracking system is set up. Here's what was created:

  landscaping-gardening/

  ├── calendar.md            ← Month-by-month task calendar for zone 8b

  ├── wishlist.md            ← Plants to research (with local nursery list)
  ├── zones/
  │   ├── zone-a-front-yard.md    ← Full sun, south-facing (~800 ft²)
  │   ├── zone-b-backyard-sun.md  ← Part sun, south backyard (~1000 ft²)
  │   └── zone-c-backyard-shade.md ← Under the oak (~1000 ft²)

  └── plans/                 ← For seasonal plans & design sketches


  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  Why three zones matter: Your property has three genuinely distinct
  microclimates. The south-facing front yard could be 10-15°F warmer than under
  the oak on a summer day, with dramatically different soil moisture. Tracking
  them separately means you can match plants to conditions instead of fighting
  the site.

  The oak tree is your most valuable asset — mature oaks in Portland add
  significant property value, provide cooling, and support dozens of native
  species. The zone files flag protecting its root zone because the #1 way
  people kill established oaks is by changing grade or drainage within the drip
  line.

  What to do this week (mid-February)

  Since you're right at the start of the growing season ramp-up:

  1. Walk & photograph each zone — note what's already growing
  2. Soil test — OSU Extension Lab is $20-30 and tells you pH, nutrients, and
  organic matter
  3. Seed ordering — if you want summer vegetables, start tomato/pepper seeds
  indoors now
  4. Check the oak — a certified arborist visit (~$100-200) is worth it for a
  mature tree

  Want me to help with anything specific — like suggesting plants for a
  particular zone, building out a planting plan, or adding anything to the
  tracking system?
