## Treatment Plan
1. Remove affected leaves immediately — bag and trash, do not compost
2. Switch to morning watering at soil level (stop overhead watering)
3. Mulch 2-3" straw or bark around plants to prevent soil-splash
4. Apply copper fungicide (OMRI-listed) by 2026-02-28; reapply every 7-10 days during wet weather
5. Improve spacing to 18-24" between plants for airflow
6. Fertilize lightly with balanced organic fertilizer (fish emulsion) to support recovery
7. Stake or cage plants once they size up
