All files updated. Here's a summary of the time-based follow-ups now in your calendar:

| Date | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Feb 21 (today)** | Prune diseased leaves, mulch bed, switch watering |
| **Feb 28** | First copper fungicide application |
| **Mar 7** | Reapply copper, inspect for new spots |
| **Mar 14** | Reapply copper if wet; stake/cage if needed |
| **Mar 21** | Reassess — continue or stop copper |
| **Mar 28** | Light organic fertilizer application |

The single most impactful change you can make today is **stopping the overhead evening watering**. Morning watering at soil level eliminates the two biggest drivers of early blight spread: prolonged overnight leaf wetness and soil-to-leaf splash.
