I've opened the preview in Chrome. Here's what changed:

| Feature | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| **Fire pit** | West side (left) | East side (right) |
| **Raised beds** | 4, east side (right) | 2, west side (left) |
| **Seating** | Near patio (unchanged) | Near patio (unchanged) |

The two raised beds are stacked vertically on the west side where the fire pit used to be, and the fire pit now occupies the east side.

Does this layout look good, or would you like any adjustments before I save it?
