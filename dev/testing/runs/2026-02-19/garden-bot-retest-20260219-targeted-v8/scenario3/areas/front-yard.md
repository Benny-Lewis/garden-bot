# Front Yard

- Dimensions: 30 × 15 ft (yard) + 5 ft planting strip (sidewalk to curb)
- Orientation: South-facing, full sun
- Existing: Concrete walkway (4 ft wide, slightly right of center), 2 ft foundation strip
- Style: Clean modern PNW native with stealth edibles

## Design

### Zone Summary

**Foundation strip (2 ft, along house):** Gravel mulch with low Oregon grape (*Mahonia nervosa*) and stealth culinary herbs (rosemary west of walkway, thyme east). The gravel creates a clean edge against the house and suppresses weeds; the low Oregon grape is native evergreen that stays under 2 ft.

**Left bed (14 ft, west of walkway):**
- *Back row:* 4 blueberries in formal hedge form — reads as boxwood but produces fruit June–August. Spaced 3.5 ft on center.
- *Mid blocks:* Karl Foerster feather reed grass (vertical architecture, year-round structure) alongside a native perennial block of yarrow + native aster for seasonal color and pollinator support.
- *Front:* Gravel groundplane with creeping thyme planted in gaps — stealth edible, fragrant when walked on.

**Right bed (12 ft, east of walkway):**
- *Back row:* 4 evergreen huckleberry (*Vaccinium ovatum*) in formal hedge — native, evergreen, edible berries September–October. Reads as a polished hedge.
- *Mid:* Bay laurel trained as a standard (lollipop form) for year-round structure + culinary leaves. Two artichokes as architectural accents — dramatic silvery foliage + edible buds.
- *Front:* Gravel with sedum groundcover for low-water, clean finish.

**Planting strip (5 ft, sidewalk to curb):** Gravel base with 1 multi-stem serviceberry (*Amelanchier alnifolia*) — PNW native, white spring blossoms, edible berries June. Underplanted with Roemer's fescue native bunch grass blocks for structure and low maintenance.

### Key Decisions

- **Stealth edibles over overt food garden** — every edible plant fills a conventional landscape role (hedge, specimen tree, groundcover) so the design reads as polished curb appeal first.
- **Blueberry + huckleberry dual hedges** — two berry seasons (June–Aug and Sep–Oct) with year-round evergreen structure on both sides of the walkway.
- **Gravel mulch throughout** — matches Portland dry-summer climate, suppresses weeds, creates the modern/clean aesthetic. No bark mulch to refresh.
- **Open sightline to door** — low front plantings and a clear walkway keep the entry inviting and visible from the street.
- **Native-first plant palette** — huckleberry, Oregon grape, serviceberry, yarrow, aster, Roemer's fescue are all PNW natives. Non-natives (blueberry, bay laurel, rosemary, thyme, artichoke) are chosen for edible value and climate compatibility.

### Optional Ideas
- Uplighting on the serviceberry for nighttime curb appeal
- Stepping stones through the left gravel area for secondary access
- Seasonal bulbs (camas) in the planting strip for spring color
