Both layouts should now be open in Chrome. Here's a summary of each:

---

## Option A — Cottage Edible Garden

A relaxed, abundant feel with curved beds and mixed plantings.

| Zone | Plants | Role |
|------|--------|------|
| Left foundation | 3 blueberry bushes + lavender edging | Evergreen hedge with spring/summer fruit |
| Left mid-bed | Rosemary, thyme, kale, chard, sage | Herb groundcover + seasonal greens |
| Left front | Dwarf apple tree | Focal point, spring blossoms + fall fruit |
| Right foundation | Fig tree + oregano + nasturtium | Warm-wall fruiting + edible flowers |
| Right mid-bed | Strawberry groundcover + 2 artichokes | Low-maintenance edible carpet + sculptural form |
| Right front | Echinacea, bee balm, chive flowers | Pollinator patch (curb appeal color) |

**Pros:** Maximum edible variety, lush/full appearance, great pollinator support
**Cons:** Higher maintenance (seasonal replanting of greens), less structured look

---

## Option B — Modern Clean Edible

Geometric beds, gravel edges, and a curated plant palette for a tidy, contemporary look.

| Zone | Plants | Role |
|------|--------|------|
| Left wall | Espaliered pear (flat-trained) | Sculptural fruit tree, space-efficient |
| Left raised bed | Lettuce, herbs, peppers (seasonal rotation) | Tidy edible bed, easy to maintain |
| Left mid | 2 blueberries + Karl Foerster grass | Structure + fruit |
| Left street edge | Gravel strip + rosemary + sedum | Low-water, low-maintenance border |
| Right foundation | Evergreen huckleberry hedge | Native, evergreen, edible berries |
| Right mid | Bay laurel standard + thyme carpet | Year-round structure + culinary herb |
| Right accent | 3 artichokes in a row | Architectural drama |
| Right street edge | Gravel + lavender block | Clean, fragrant border |

**Pros:** Lower maintenance, clean curb appeal year-round, strong winter structure
**Cons:** Fewer edible species, less abundant harvest, more hardscape cost (gravel)

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Zone 8b Portland design considerations:**
- South-facing front yards get 6-8 hours of summer sun — enough for nearly any edible.
- Espaliered fruit trees (Option B) are a European technique that trains trees flat against a wall, saving space while maximizing sun exposure from the warm house wall.
- Evergreen huckleberry (*Vaccinium ovatum*) is a PNW native that doubles as a polished hedge and produces edible berries — a great "stealth edible" for curb appeal.

**A few questions to help refine:**
- Which style appeals to you more — the **lush cottage (A)** or the **clean modern (B)**, or elements of both?
- Is the existing walkway centered as shown, and is it roughly the width depicted (~4 ft)?
- How much ongoing maintenance are you comfortable with — weekly tending, or more of a plant-it-and-forget-it approach?
