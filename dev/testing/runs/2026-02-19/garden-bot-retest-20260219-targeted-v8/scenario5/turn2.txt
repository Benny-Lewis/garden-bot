Both previews should be open in Chrome. Here's a comparison:

---

## Option A: Woodland Path

**Concept:** Irregular stepping stones meander through a moss carpet, flanked by lush PNW native plantings. A single Japanese maple anchors the center as a focal point.

**Plant palette:**
- **North (fence):** Sword fern (*Polystichum munitum*) + Oregon grape (*Mahonia aquifolium*) — evergreen mass
- **South (house wall):** Low salal (*Gaultheria shallon*) + moss panels
- **Groundcover:** Sheet moss between stones
- **Focal:** Japanese maple (*Acer palmatum*), compact cultivar
- **Accents:** Two placement rocks

**Tradeoffs:**
- More naturalistic, looser feel — stronger PNW identity
- Stepping stones require careful setting to stay level over time
- Moss groundcover needs occasional weeding but no mowing
- Less defined path edge — relaxed but slightly less tidy

---

## Option B: Zen Corridor

**Concept:** A straight 3-ft decomposed granite path with stone edging creates clean circulation. Japanese maple at the west entry, a *tsukubai* (stone water basin) at the east end as a destination moment.

**Plant palette:**
- **North (fence):** Deer fern (*Blechnum spicant*) mass + compact nandina screen
- **South (house wall):** Kinnikinnick (*Arctostaphylos uva-ursi*) groundcover + moss panels
- **Focal:** Japanese maple at west, tsukubai at east
- **Accents:** Rocks grouped near water basin

**Tradeoffs:**
- Cleaner, more structured — stronger Japanese garden influence
- DG path is easy to maintain (rake occasionally, top-dress yearly)
- Water basin adds sound/interest but needs a recirculating pump or manual filling
- Nandina is not PNW-native (some consider it mildly invasive in OR) — could substitute with *Sarcococca* if native purity matters

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- **Moss as groundcover** is ideal here: Portland's rainfall and partial shade are exactly what moss wants, and it ties both aesthetics together — it's native PNW *and* central to Japanese garden design.
- **Narrow corridors benefit from restraint**: with only 8 ft of width, limiting the palette to 3-4 species per option avoids visual clutter and keeps the space feeling larger.

Which option speaks to you, or would you like to mix elements from both? (For example, Option A's stepping stones with Option B's tsukubai.)
