Design saved. Here's a summary of the changes:

`? Insight -------------------------------------`
**Reducing beds from 4?2** frees up significant space for the fire pit lounge while still giving you ~100 sq ft of growing area. In Portland's 8b zone, two well-managed 10×5 beds can be very productive — succession planting and interplanting will help you get the most out of them.
