## Option A: Woodland Path

A **meandering stepping-stone path** through layered native woodland plantings.

| Zone | What | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| West strip (3 ft) | Utility access path | Required clearance |
| Central corridor | Irregular stepping stones through moss groundcover | Japanese *roji* (tea garden path) feel — slows you down, invites looking |
| Mid-canopy | **Vine maple** (upper third) | Arching form screens the space, native understory tree, fall color |
| Ground layer | **Sword ferns** (3 clusters) | Year-round structure, zero maintenance |
| Fence border | **Oregon grape** (continuous) | Evergreen screen, winter blooms, native |
| Focal point | **Stone lantern** (2/3 down path) | Japanese accent, draws the eye along the journey |
| Groundcover | **Moss** throughout | Replaces lawn, thrives in east-facing shade |

**Character:** Feels like walking through a forest clearing. More immersive, softer.

## Option B: Gravel Courtyard

A **central raked gravel panel** framed by concentrated planting beds at north and south ends.

| Zone | What | Why |
|------|-------|-----|
| West strip (3 ft) | Utility access path | Required clearance |
| Center (11.5 ft) | **Raked gravel courtyard** with accent boulder | Japanese *karesansui* (dry garden) — open, meditative, very low maintenance |
| North bed | **Red huckleberry** + deer ferns | Native screening at entry, berries for birds |
| South bed | **Vine maple** + sword fern + salal | Layered native planting, year-round green |
| Focal point | **Tsukubai** (stone water basin) off-center in gravel | Traditional Japanese element, asymmetric placement |
| Gravel edges | Moss border softening | Blurs the hard/soft transition |

**Character:** More architectural and open. A room to pause in, not just pass through.

`? Insight -------------------------------------`
**Design tradeoffs at play:**
- **Option A** maximizes planting and feels more "PNW forest" — the Japanese influence is subtle (path rhythm, lantern, editing). Better if you want to *be in* the garden.
- **Option B** maximizes negative space (gravel) and feels more "Japanese garden" — the PNW influence comes from the plant palette. Better if you want to *look at* the garden. It's also lower maintenance since gravel needs only occasional raking vs. moss establishment.
`-------------------------------------------------`

**Questions to help you choose:**

1. **How do you use this side yard?** Mostly passing through, or do you ever stop/sit here?
2. **Do you lean more PNW-forest or more Japanese-garden?** Option A is 70/30 PNW/Japanese, Option B is 40/60.
3. **Any elements you'd want to mix between the two?** (e.g., stepping stones from A with the gravel courtyard from B)

Which direction speaks to you, or what would you change?
