# Backyard

**Size:** 40 × 30 ft (1,200 sq ft)
**Sun:** Mixed — shade under oak (north half), more sun on south half
**Current state:** Lawn + mature oak + patio

## Soil
- Clay, compacts easily
- Slow drainage in winter

## Features
- **Mature oak:** North half of yard; provides shade canopy
- **Patio:** 10 × 12 ft, south side of yard
- **Hose bib:** Near patio

## Zones
- **Under oak (north half):** Shade garden potential; tree roots compete for water/nutrients
- **South half (around patio):** Best sun exposure in backyard; prime spot for edibles or container gardening near the hose

## Plans
- Small edible area near patio (easy water access)
- Shade-tolerant plantings under oak as budget/interest allows
