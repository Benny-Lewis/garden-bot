I have your profile — Portland, zone 8b, mid-February. Since we're well before your last frost date, these seedlings must be indoors. The symptom pattern you're describing is very suggestive of one particular disease, but before I confirm, I need a few details to rule out other possibilities:

1. **Where are the seedlings growing?** Indoors under lights, on a windowsill, in a greenhouse, or cold frame?
2. **How are you watering?** From above (overhead) or bottom-watering? How often?
3. **What's the container situation?** Cell trays, pots, soil blocks? What potting mix?
4. **How old are the seedlings**, and when did you start them?
5. **Are the spots spreading upward** to newer leaves, or staying on just the lowest ones?

`? Insight -------------------------------------`
The combination of **yellowing lower leaves** + **brown spots with concentric rings** (a "target" or "bullseye" pattern) is a textbook symptom of **Early Blight** (*Alternaria solani* or *A. tomatophila*). However, good diagnostics never rely on symptoms alone — growing conditions like humidity, air circulation, and watering method dramatically affect which diseases can actually take hold on seedlings. That's why the follow-up questions matter.

Saved: none — waiting for your answers before confirming diagnosis and recording recommendations.
