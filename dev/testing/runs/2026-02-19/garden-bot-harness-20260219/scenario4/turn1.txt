Now I have the full picture. Here's the current state and the updated design:

`? Insight -------------------------------------`
The current design has the fire pit on the **west side** with the bench, and **4 raised beds in a 2x2 grid** on the east side. "Opposite side" means moving the fire pit from west to east, and reducing beds from 4 to 2 frees up space for it there.

Here's the updated layout with the fire pit moved to the **east side** and beds reduced to **2**:

```

+--------------------------------------+
| Patio                                |
|  [Bench]                             |
|                                      |
|  [Bed 1]  [Bed 2]      [Fire Pit]   |
|                                      |
+--------------------------------------+

**What changed:**
- **Fire pit** moved from west to east side
- **Raised beds** reduced from 4 (2x2 grid) to 2 (single row), staying on the west/center area
- **Bench** stays on the west near the patio — still accessible but now separated from the fire pit

A few spatial questions before I save:

1. **Bench placement** — Do you want the bench to move with the fire pit to the east side (as a lounge pairing), or keep it on the west near the beds as shown?
2. **Bed positioning** — The 2 remaining beds are shown side-by-side on the west/center. Would you prefer them along the south edge, or is this placement good?
