# Calendar
## February
- Clean and prep tools
- Monitor tomato seedlings for early blight progression after switching to bottom watering
- If blight spreads to upper leaves after 5-7 days: apply copper fungicide

## April (after mid-April last frost)
- Transplant tomatoes outdoors — mulch base, prune lowest branches, water at base only
