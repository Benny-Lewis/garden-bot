`? Insight -------------------------------------`
**Why I'm asking before diagnosing:** The symptoms you describe — yellowing lower leaves with concentric brown spots — strongly suggest **early blight** (*Alternaria solani*), which produces characteristic "target spot" or "bullseye" lesions. However, similar symptoms can also result from nutrient deficiency (especially nitrogen or magnesium), overwatering/fungal damping-off issues, or even cold stress. The growing conditions help narrow it down significantly.
`-------------------------------------------------`

To give you the most accurate diagnosis, could you tell me:

1. **Where are the seedlings growing?** Indoors under grow lights, on a windowsill, or in a greenhouse/cold frame?

2. **How are you watering?** From the top or bottom, and how often?

3. **What medium are they in?** Seed starting mix, potting soil, garden soil, or peat pellets?

4. **How old are the seedlings, and have you fertilized them?**

These details matter because in mid-February in Portland, indoor seedlings are in a very different environment than outdoor plants, and the cause and treatment will differ accordingly. For example, if they're in a small cell with seed starting mix and haven't been fed, nutrient depletion of the lower leaves is common and looks similar to early fungal disease — but the fix is completely different.
