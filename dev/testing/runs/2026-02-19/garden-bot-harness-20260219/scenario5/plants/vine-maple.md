# Vine Maple (*Acer circinatum*)

- Role: Specimen tree
- Location: Side yard — garden room, set toward east fence
- Native range: PNW coastal forests, BC to Northern California
- Size: 15-20' tall, multi-stem form
- Sun: Part shade to full shade (tolerates morning sun)
- Water: Low once established — no irrigation needed after year 2
- Soil: Adaptable, prefers well-drained
- Growth rate: Moderate
- Fall color: Orange to red, brilliant
- Wildlife: Seeds for birds, host plant for native moths
- Notes: Chosen over Japanese maple as the native analog — same multi-stem grace with better local adaptation. Prune selectively to maintain open, layered canopy.
