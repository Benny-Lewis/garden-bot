Your garden is now being tracked. Here's what I set up:

`? Insight -------------------------------------`
**Key takeaways for your property:**
- **Front yard** — south-facing full sun is your best asset. PNW-native perennials and ornamental grasses can give you year-round curb appeal with almost zero maintenance once established.
- **Backyard edibles** — the sunny area between the patio and the oak's drip line is the sweet spot. Raised beds are strongly recommended here: they sidestep your clay drainage problems, warm up faster in spring, and keep you from battling compacted soil.
- **The oak** — protect it. Don't dig, grade, or pile soil within the drip line. Shade-tolerant groundcovers (sword fern, wild ginger) work beautifully under PNW oaks.

From here, some natural next steps whenever you're ready:
- **Design a front yard layout** — plan which areas to convert from lawn to low-maintenance beds
- **Plan your edible area** — size, raised bed placement, what to grow this first season
- **Start a spring task calendar** — February/March is when Portland gardeners start prepping beds and starting seeds indoors
