# Backyard

## Dimensions
40 × 30 ft (1,200 sq ft)

## Conditions
- **Sun:** Mixed — south side gets good sun, north half shaded by large oak
- **Soil:** Clay, compacts easily
- **Drainage:** Slow in winter, especially under/around oak canopy
- **Current state:** Lawn/open ground with mature oak and patio

## Features
- **Oak tree:** Large, north half of yard. Provides heavy shade and likely has extensive root zone.
- **Patio:** 10 × 12 ft, south side of backyard. Adjacent to hose bib.

## Goals
Small edible garden area, likely near patio where sun and water access are best.

## Plants
_None yet._

## Notes
- The area between the patio and the oak's drip line is the best candidate for a small raised-bed edible garden — it gets the most sun and is closest to water.
- Under-oak area suits shade-tolerant groundcovers or ferns. Avoid heavy digging near oak roots.
- Raised beds would help with the clay/drainage issues and keep edibles out of compacted soil.
