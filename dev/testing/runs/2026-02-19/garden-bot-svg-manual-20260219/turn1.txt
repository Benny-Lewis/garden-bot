Both layouts should now be open in your browser. Here's a summary of the tradeoffs:

## Option A: Central Path
| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Beds** | 3 beds (~14×4 ft each) = **~168 sq ft** of growing space |
| **Seating** | ~8×6 ft — cozy, fits a small bistro set |
| **Compost** | SE corner — slightly farther from patio |
| **Flow** | Central path splits the space symmetrically |
| **Best for** | Maximizing food production |

## Option B: L-shaped Beds
| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| **Beds** | Long south bed (~36×4 ft) + east bed (~4×8 ft) = **~176 sq ft** |
| **Seating** | ~12×8 ft — generous, fits a table + 4 chairs comfortably |
| **Compost** | NE corner — right off the patio for easy kitchen-scrap access |
| **Flow** | Open center creates a more relaxed feel |
| **Best for** | Balancing gathering space with production |

`? Insight -------------------------------------`
- **Compost placement matters:** Option B puts it near the kitchen door (via patio), which makes daily kitchen-scrap composting much more likely to actually happen
- **South-facing bed orientation:** The long east-west bed in Option B catches maximum sun — ideal for tomatoes, peppers, and other heat-lovers in Portland's Zone 8b
- **Clay loam + raised beds:** Great combo — raised beds solve clay drainage issues while you can amend the soil inside with compost from your own bin over time

Which option do you prefer, or would you like me to combine elements from both? For example, I could put the larger seating area from B with the 3-bed arrangement from A.
