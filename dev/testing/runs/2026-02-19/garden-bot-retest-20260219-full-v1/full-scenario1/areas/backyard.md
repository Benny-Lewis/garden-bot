# Backyard

- **Dimensions:** 40 × 30 ft
- **Sun:** Mixed — shaded under oak (north half), more sun on south half
- **Current state:** Large oak tree (north half), 10 × 12 patio
- **Soil:** Heavy clay (unamended)
- **Irrigation:** Hose bib located near patio

## Features

- **Oak tree** — north half; provides canopy shade. Defines the shade/sun split for planting.
- **Patio** — 10 × 12 ft; potential hub for container edibles and seating.

## Notes

- South half (sunny side) is the prime zone for raised-bed edibles and sun-loving pollinator plants.
- Under the oak: shade-tolerant natives, ferns, or woodland groundcovers.
- Hose bib proximity makes the patio area easiest to irrigate first.
