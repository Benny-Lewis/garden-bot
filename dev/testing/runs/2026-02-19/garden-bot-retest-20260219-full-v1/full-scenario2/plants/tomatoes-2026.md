## Treatment Plan
1. Remove all affected leaves; sanitize pruners between cuts
2. Switch to morning base watering (drip or soil-line); stop overhead watering
3. Mulch bed with 2-3" straw/bark to block spore splash
4. Add row cover or cold frame for frost protection
5. Stake/cage plants; maintain 24"+ spacing for airflow
6. Monitor weekly for new spots; remove infected leaves promptly
7. Fertilize lightly in 2 weeks (balanced tomato fertilizer)
8. If disease spreads despite cultural changes, apply copper-based fungicide per label
