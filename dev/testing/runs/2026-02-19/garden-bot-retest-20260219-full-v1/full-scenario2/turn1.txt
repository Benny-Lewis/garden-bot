I found your profile — thanks for tracking your garden. Here's what I see:

- **Location:** Portland, OR (Zone 8b, last frost Apr 15)
- **Tomatoes:** Mixed slicer types, started indoors, transplanted to the backyard south raised bed on **Feb 18** — just 4 days ago
- **Soil:** Clay loam

Your symptoms — **yellow lower leaves with dark brown concentric (target-shaped) spots** — are very suggestive of a specific fungal disease, but before I confirm a diagnosis I need a few more details about the growing situation:

1. **Are the seedlings under any cover** (cold frame, row cover, greenhouse, plastic)? It's still well before your last frost date (Apr 15), so I want to understand the protection setup.
2. **How are you watering** — overhead, at the base, how often? Has the soil been staying wet?
3. **How large are the seedlings** — how many true leaf sets? Are the yellow leaves the cotyledons (seed leaves) or the first true leaves?
4. **Any other plants nearby showing symptoms?**

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
The concentric ring ("target spot") pattern is a hallmark of **Alternaria** fungi — but transplant shock, cold stress, and overwatering can also yellow lower leaves in newly transplanted seedlings, especially when set out this early in Zone 8b. Getting the full picture before diagnosing prevents misidentifying a cultural problem as a disease (or vice versa).

**Wait for your answers** and I'll give you a source-backed diagnosis with a treatment plan.
