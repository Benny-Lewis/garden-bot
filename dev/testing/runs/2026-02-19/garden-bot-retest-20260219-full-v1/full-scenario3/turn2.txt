Both options should now be open in Chrome. Here's the comparison:

---

## Option A: Symmetric Modern

**Layout:** Matching beds flank the walkway in a balanced, geometric arrangement.

| Zone | Plants |
|------|--------|
| Left bed | 3 blueberries in a row + ornamental fescue |
| Right bed | Sage, thyme, sage — structured herb block |
| Lower left | Kinnikinnick groundcover + alpine strawberry edge |
| Lower right | Low Oregon grape + creeping thyme edge |
| Foundation | Rosemary bookends + sword fern center |
| Planting strip | Native sedge |

**Pros:** Very clean, orderly curb appeal. Easy to maintain symmetry. Clear visual structure from the street.
**Cons:** More formal — less naturalistic feel. Blueberries in a straight row can look hedged.

---

## Option B: Asymmetric Drift

**Layout:** One large sweeping bed on the left with a small serviceberry tree as anchor; a compact herb/gravel garden on the right.

| Zone | Plants |
|------|--------|
| Left drift | Serviceberry (small tree) + 2 blueberries + fescue + kinnikinnick/strawberry groundcover |
| Right upper | Sage, lavender, oregano herb row |
| Right lower | Gravel garden with Oregon grape + grass accent |
| Foundation | Sword fern, rosemary, evergreen huckleberry |
| Planting strip | Ornamental grass + native sedge |

**Pros:** More naturalistic, true PNW feel. Serviceberry adds vertical interest + spring bloom + edible berries. Evergreen huckleberry in the foundation doubles as a stealth edible.
**Cons:** Asymmetry requires more careful maintenance to keep looking intentional. Serviceberry needs annual pruning to stay compact.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Stealth edibles in both options:** Blueberries (fall color rivals any ornamental shrub), alpine strawberry (evergreen groundcover with tiny fruit), rosemary and thyme (read as ornamental). Option B adds serviceberry (native, stunning spring bloom, birds love the fruit) and evergreen huckleberry (broadleaf evergreen that looks like boxwood but produces berries).
