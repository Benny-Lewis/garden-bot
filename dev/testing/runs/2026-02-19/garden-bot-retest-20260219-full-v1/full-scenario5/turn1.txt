Great starting point! I've got your garden context:

- **Portland, OR / Zone 8b** — perfect for both PNW natives and Japanese-inspired plantings
- **Side yard: 24 × 8 ft**, east-west corridor, partial shade, fence on the north edge, existing narrow path
- **Style goal:** PNW native look with Japanese influence

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
A 24×8 ft corridor is a classic "pass-through" space. The Japanese garden tradition excels here — Japanese tea garden *roji* (dewy path) passages are designed exactly for narrow, linear spaces. Combined with PNW natives, you get a design that feels both intentional and regionally grounded.

Before I sketch options, one question at a time. First:

**How do you primarily use this side yard — is it mainly a walkway to get from front to back, or do you want it to also be a place to pause and linger (a small seating nook, a contemplative spot)?**
