---

### Option A: Roji Passage (Tea Garden Path)

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Path** | Irregular stepping stones through native moss groundcover |
| **North bed** | Vine Maple (2) + Sword Fern (3) — tall, layered against fence |
| **South bed** | Oregon Grape + Kinnikinnick — low evergreen structure |
| **Focal point** | Tsukubai (stone basin) at the 2/3 mark — classic roji element |
| **Japanese feel** | Strong — deliberate asymmetry, stepping stone rhythm, water basin |
| **Maintenance** | Very low — moss fills in naturally in Portland shade; no gravel to maintain |

**Tradeoff:** More distinctly Japanese, but the stepping stones require careful foot placement (less practical for hauling bins/gear through).

---

### Option B: Woodland Drift (Naturalistic Meander)

| Aspect | Details |
|---|---|
| **Path** | Continuous gravel path — easy to walk, wheelchair/cart friendly |
| **North bed** | Vine Maple (1) + Red Huckleberry (2) + Sword Fern (2) — more species diversity |
| **South bed** | Salal + Inside-out Flower + Oregon Grape — seasonal wildflower interest |
| **Accent** | Dry stream bed with river rock — Japanese *karesansui* nod |
| **Japanese feel** | Subtle — restraint in plant palette, dry stream, clean lines |
| **Maintenance** | Low — gravel may need occasional raking/topping |

**Tradeoff:** More functional path, richer native plant diversity, but the Japanese influence is quieter.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Stepping stones vs. gravel** is the key functional decision. In a working side yard, gravel wins for utility (wheelbarrows, trash bins). But if this corridor is purely a garden experience, stepping stones create the *ma* (間) — the deliberate pause between steps that defines Japanese garden movement.

**Which direction appeals to you — A, B, or a hybrid?** For example, we could combine A's stepping stones + basin with B's richer native plant mix.
