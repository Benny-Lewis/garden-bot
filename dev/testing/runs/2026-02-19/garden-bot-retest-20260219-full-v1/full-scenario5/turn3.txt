**Why all PNW natives work for Japanese style:** Japanese garden aesthetics are about *restraint, asymmetry, and borrowed scenery* — not specific species. Oregon Grape fills the nandina role (holly-like evergreen with berries), Vine Maple substitutes for Japanese Maple (same genus, similar grace), and native moss/ferns are essentially interchangeable with their Japanese counterparts. The result is regionally authentic *and* zero-irrigation in Portland's climate.
