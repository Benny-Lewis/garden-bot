The skill's **preview-vs-canonical gating** is a key safety pattern: preview SVGs go into `areas/` with `-option-a` suffixes during iteration, while canonical files (`-layout.svg`, area `.md`, `log/`, `calendar.md`) are only written after explicit approval. This prevents half-baked designs from overwriting committed state. The log file is append-only — new entries are added at the end, never reordering or editing previous entries — preserving a reliable audit trail.

Design saved. Here's what was updated:

- **Layout SVG** — fire pit now east, 2 raised beds on west
- **Area file** — updated zone summary and key decisions documenting the changes and rationale
- **Log** — appended the revision entry for today
