`? Insight -------------------------------------`
Your profile tells me you're in **Portland, OR (Zone 8b)** with **clay loam** soil. It's late February — cucumbers wouldn't normally be outdoors this time of year in Portland, so the growing context matters a lot for accurate diagnosis.
`-------------------------------------------------`

I found your profile — Portland, OR, Zone 8b, clay loam soil. No cucumber records yet, so I have a few questions to narrow this down before I give you a diagnosis:

1. **Indoor or outdoor?** — It's February in Portland, so are these in a greenhouse, under grow lights indoors, or something else?
2. **Container or in-ground?**
3. **Watering** — How often, and do you water overhead (splashing the leaves) or at the base?
4. **Air circulation** — Are the plants crowded together, or do they have good airflow around them?
5. **When did you first notice the white coating?** — Did it appear suddenly or spread gradually?

The powdery white coating strongly suggests **powdery mildew**, which is the #1 most common cucurbit disease, but I want to confirm the conditions before giving you a treatment plan.
