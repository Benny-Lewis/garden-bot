Good — I can see you're in **Portland, OR (Zone 8b)** with **clay loam soil**, and you have **roses in the front yard** already noted with occasional leaf spots.

Before I give a specific diagnosis, the skill requires me to clarify your growing situation so I don't jump to the wrong conclusion. A few questions:

1. **Are the spots dark/black, reddish-purple, or yellowish?** Any concentric rings or fringed edges?
2. **Do the affected leaves yellow and drop prematurely**, or do they mostly stay on the plant?
3. **How are the roses watered** — overhead sprinkler, drip, or hand-watered at the base?
4. **Any recent changes** — new mulch, pruning, nearby construction, different fertilizer?

`? Insight -------------------------------------`
Several fungal diseases cause leaf spots on roses, and the most common ones in the Pacific Northwest include **black spot** (*Diplocarpon rosae*), **cercospora leaf spot**, and **anthracnose**. Portland's wet climate (Zone 8b, maritime) is especially favorable for black spot, which thrives in humid conditions with leaf wetness. The symptom details — spot color, shape, and whether leaves drop — are key to distinguishing between them.

Knowing what the spots look like and your watering habits will let me narrow it down and point you to the right extension service guidance.
