`? Insight -------------------------------------`
The landscape-design skill requires me to **read existing files first** and **never assume dimensions**. Your backyard file already has dimensions (40x30 ft), so that's covered. But the skill also says I should ask rather than assume what goes in the space.

Great — I found your existing garden data:

- **Location:** Portland, OR (Zone 8b, clay loam)
- **Backyard:** 40x30 ft, mixed sun, existing patio and lawn

Before I create layout options, I need a few details about your entertaining vision:

1. **What features do you want?** For example: dining table area, fire pit, grill/outdoor kitchen, seating lounge, string lights, planting borders, water feature, etc.
2. **Where is the existing patio?** (e.g., against the house along the 40 ft side? a corner?)
3. **Any style preference?** (e.g., modern/clean, cozy/rustic, PNW native plantings)
4. **Budget-sensitive constraints?** (e.g., keep existing patio hardscape, no new concrete)

I'll then create two SVG layout options with tradeoffs for you to compare.
