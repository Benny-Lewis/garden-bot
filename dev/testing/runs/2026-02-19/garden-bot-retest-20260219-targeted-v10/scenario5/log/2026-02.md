- 2026-02-18: Noted side yard redesign goal.
- 2026-02-21: Approved side yard design — "Woodland Corridor" (Option B). PNW native + Japanese influence, low maintenance. DG path, sword fern + red huckleberry north bed, kinnikinnick/moss/Oregon grape south groundcover, nurse log accent, vine maple specimen east end. Saved canonical layout, plant files, and calendar.
