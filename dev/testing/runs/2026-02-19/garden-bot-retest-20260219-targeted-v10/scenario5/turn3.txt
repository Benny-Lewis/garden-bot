`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
The Woodland Corridor design works so well here because it solves the core tension in a narrow side yard: **movement vs. planting**. The offset DG curve creates a sense of depth that a straight path can't — a Japanese garden technique called *nobedan* (staggered path) adapted to casual Western materials. The three-layer structure (tall fence screen → path → low groundcover) compresses a forest edge into 8 feet of width.
