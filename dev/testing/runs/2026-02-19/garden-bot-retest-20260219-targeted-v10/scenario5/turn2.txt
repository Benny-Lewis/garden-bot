Both layouts should now be open in Chrome. Here's the comparison, with your **low maintenance** priority highlighted:

---

## Option A: Moss Garden Path (Japanese-Leaning)

| Zone | Plants / Materials |
|------|-------------------|
| **North bed** (along fence) | Sword fern + cloud-pruned vine maple |
| **Ground plane** | Moss carpet with irregular basalt stepping stones |
| **South bed** | Low Oregon grape (west half) + kinnikinnick (east half) |
| **West entry** | Basalt boulder grouping |
| **East accent** | Stone lantern |

**Character:** Meditative, formal. Stepping stones slow the pace. Cloud-pruned vine maple is the signature Japanese element.

---

## Option B: Woodland Corridor (PNW-Leaning)

| Zone | Plants / Materials |
|------|-------------------|
| **North bed** (along fence) | Sword fern mass (west) + red huckleberry screen (east) |
| **Path** | Decomposed granite, gentle curve |
| **South bed** | Kinnikinnick → moss patches → low Oregon grape |
| **Accents** | Nurse log (mid-corridor) + vine maple specimen (east) |

**Character:** Loose, naturalistic forest-floor feel. DG path is easy-care and drains well.

## Tradeoffs — with Low Maintenance Lens

| Factor | Option A (Moss Path) | Option B (Woodland) |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Maintenance** | **Higher** — moss needs consistent moisture + weeding; cloud pruning is annual skilled work | **Lower** — DG path self-drains, groundcovers fill in, vine maple grows naturally |
| **Japanese feel** | Strong — stone lantern, stepping stones, cloud pruning | Subtler — vine maple form, asymmetric nurse-log accent |
| **PNW native feel** | Present but restrained | Dominant — huckleberry, nurse log, DG |
| **Winter screening** | High — all evergreen along fence | Mixed — huckleberry is deciduous |
| **Path usability** | Stepping stones (deliberate, uneven footing) | DG gravel (even, cart/wheelbarrow friendly) |
| **Summer resilience** | Moss risks browning in dry spells | DG + tough groundcovers handle drought fine |

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- **Moss vs. DG is the pivotal choice.** Portland's wet winters grow moss beautifully, but increasingly hot summers stress it. If low maintenance is a priority, DG with *patches* of moss (Option B's approach) gives you the look without full commitment.
- **Cloud pruning (Option A) is beautiful but ongoing work** — you'd prune 1-2x/year to maintain the sculptural form. An unpruned vine maple (Option B) is equally striking in a more natural way, and zero effort.
- **You can mix elements.** Option B's DG path + Option A's stone lantern and boulder grouping would give you Japanese accents on a low-maintenance PNW backbone.
