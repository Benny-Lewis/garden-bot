Both layouts should be open in Chrome. Here's how they compare:

---

## Option A: Moss Garden Path (Japanese-Leaning)

| Zone | What | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| **North bed** | Sword fern + cloud-pruned vine maple along fence | Layered evergreen screen; vine maple gets sculptural Japanese-style pruning |
| **Ground plane** | Moss carpet with irregular basalt stepping stones | Classic Japanese garden circulation — slow, contemplative walk |
| **South bed** | Low Oregon grape (west) + kinnikinnick mat (east) | Native groundcovers that stay low, won't crowd the 8-ft width |
| **West entry** | Basalt boulder grouping | Asymmetric stone focal point anchors the entrance |
| **East accent** | Stone lantern | Japanese focal element visible from the path's end |

**Character:** Quiet, meditative, formal-feeling. Moss demands the most maintenance (occasional weeding, keeping foot traffic on stones).

---

## Option B: Woodland Corridor (PNW-Leaning)

| Zone | What | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| **North bed** | Sword fern mass (west) + red huckleberry screen (east) | Tall native layers — fern for evergreen, huckleberry for berries + fall color |
| **Path** | Decomposed granite with gentle curve | Casual woodland feel, easier maintenance than moss, drains well |
| **South bed** | Kinnikinnick → moss patches → low Oregon grape | Groundcover mosaic adds texture without height |
| **Accent** | Nurse log (mid-path) + vine maple specimen (east) | PNW forest floor feel; vine maple grows naturally sculptural |

**Character:** Looser, more naturalistic. DG path is lower-maintenance than moss. Red huckleberry adds seasonal food and color but is deciduous (less winter screening).

## Key Tradeoffs

| Factor | Option A (Moss Path) | Option B (Woodland) |
|--------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Japanese feel** | Stronger — stone lantern, stepping stones, cloud pruning | Subtler — vine maple form, asymmetry |
| **PNW native feel** | Present but restrained | Dominant — huckleberry, nurse log, DG |
| **Maintenance** | Higher — moss needs moisture + weeding | Lower — DG path, tougher groundcovers |
| **Winter interest** | High — all evergreen | Mixed — huckleberry drops leaves |
| **Path surface** | Stepping stones (slower, more deliberate) | Gravel (easier footing, wheelchair/cart-friendly) |

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Moss vs. DG** is the pivotal choice here. Portland's wet winters are great for moss, but summers increasingly stress it. DG with moss *patches* (Option B's approach) hedges this — you get the look without full commitment. Cloud-pruned vine maple (Option A) takes years to develop but becomes a stunning focal feature.

**Which direction speaks to you — A, B, or a mix of elements from both?** For example, you could pair Option A's stepping stones and stone lantern with Option B's huckleberry screen and nurse log.
