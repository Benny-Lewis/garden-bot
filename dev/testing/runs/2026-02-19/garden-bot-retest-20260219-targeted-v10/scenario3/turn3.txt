`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- **Stealth edible count:** 9 out of 13 plant species in this design are edible — dwarf fig, blueberry, rosemary, Oregon grape, salal, alpine strawberry, thyme, oregano, chives. Yet the front yard reads as a polished modern landscape, not a food garden.
- **Three-season edible harvest:** Herbs year-round → strawberries June–frost → blueberries June–Sept → Oregon grape/salal July–Aug → figs Aug–Sept. The calendar tasks are timed so you're planting in early April when Portland's last frost risk is past.
- **Foundation strip microclimate:** That 2 ft strip against a south-facing house wall is a heat trap — reflected warmth makes it behave more like Zone 9 for Mediterranean herbs. It's often the most underused planting space in a front yard.
