Both layouts are open in Chrome. Here's the comparison:

---

## Option A — Structured Symmetry

**Concept:** Mirrored beds flanking the walkway, clean lines, lawn retained between beds and sidewalk.

| Zone | Plants |
|------|--------|
| **Left bed** (13×6 ft) | 2 blueberries, rosemary, lavender, strawberry groundcover edge |
| **Right bed** (9×6 ft) | 1 blueberry, echinacea, salvia, strawberry groundcover edge |
| **Foundation strip** | Thyme + oregano carpet |
| **Planting strip** | 3× Karl Foerster feather reed grass |

**Stealth edibles:** Blueberries (3), rosemary, strawberry groundcover, thyme, oregano

**Tradeoffs:**
- **Pro:** Tidy, predictable, easy to maintain. Strong curb appeal — reads "intentional."
- **Pro:** Lawn retained for open feel.
- **Con:** Less food production. Less PNW-native character (Karl Foerster is Eurasian).
- **Con:** Symmetric can feel stiff in a PNW context.

## Option B — Asymmetric Drift

**Concept:** Larger sweeping left bed anchored by a dwarf fig, smaller right accent bed. Decomposed granite replaces lawn. More strongly PNW native.

| Zone | Plants |
|------|--------|
| **Left main bed** (14×7 ft) | Dwarf fig 'Petite Negra', 3 blueberries, rosemary, kinnikinnick + alpine strawberry groundcover |
| **Right accent bed** (10×5.5 ft) | Oregon grape, salal, heuchera |
| **Foundation strip** | Thyme + creeping rosemary (left), oregano + chives (right) |
| **Planting strip** | Deschampsia + Carex oshimensis (true PNW natives) |

**Stealth edibles:** Dwarf fig, blueberries (3), Oregon grape, salal, rosemary, alpine strawberry, thyme, oregano, chives

**Tradeoffs:**
- **Pro:** Higher food yield (fig + native berries). More authentically PNW.
- **Pro:** Decomposed granite = zero lawn maintenance, modern feel.
- **Con:** Asymmetry is bolder — some HOAs/neighbors may prefer traditional.
- **Con:** Fig needs winter protection in some 8b years (fleece wrap).

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- **Oregon grape** (Mahonia aquifolium) is Oregon's state flower and produces tart edible berries — perfect stealth edible that reads as a native ornamental shrub.
- **Decomposed granite** (Option B) is a signature PNW modern material — permeable, low-maintenance, and provides clean contrast against green plantings.
- Both options use the **foundation strip for herbs** — this 2 ft zone is often wasted but gets full reflected heat from the house wall, making it ideal for Mediterranean herbs.
