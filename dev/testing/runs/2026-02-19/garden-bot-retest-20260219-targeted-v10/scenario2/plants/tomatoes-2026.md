- Location: backyard south raised bed
- Date planted: 2026-02-10

## Diagnosis — Early Blight (2026-02-21)
- **Pathogen:** Alternaria solani/linariae
- **Symptoms:** Yellow lower leaves with dark brown concentric "bull's-eye" spots, progressing upward
- **Contributing factors:** Cool wet weather, overhead evening watering, no mulch barrier, early transplant (8 weeks before last frost)
- **Sources:** NC State Extension, UMN Extension, Wisconsin Horticulture Extension, UMD Extension

## Treatment Plan
- Remove all affected leaves; bag and trash (do not compost). Sanitize pruners between cuts.
- Switch from overhead evening watering to base watering in the morning.
- Mulch 2–3" of straw or bark around plants to prevent soil-splash.
- Apply copper-based fungicide (fixed copper per label); reapply every 7–10 days during wet weather.
- Prune lower leaves as plants grow — maintain 12" bare stem above mulch.
- Cover with row cover or cloches on nights below 45°F until mid-April.
- Monitor weekly for progression; reassess for Septoria leaf spot if spots change pattern.
