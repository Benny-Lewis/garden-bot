`? Insight -------------------------------------`
Portland Zone 8b is excellent for edible landscaping — mild winters allow many ornamental edibles (blueberries, herbs, espaliered fruit trees) that double as curb appeal. South-facing is ideal for fruit production.

I have your profile and front yard data — 30×15 ft, south-facing, in Portland (8b), with an existing lawn and walkway. Before I draft two layout options, I need a few spatial details:

1. **Where does the walkway run?** Center of the yard to the front door, or off to one side?
2. **Where is the front door relative to the house?** Center, left, or right when facing the house?
3. **Any existing trees, shrubs, or foundation plantings** you want to keep?
4. **Style preference?** For example: tidy/formal, cottage/lush, modern/clean-lined, or Pacific Northwest native?

These will shape how I arrange the edible and ornamental zones in the layout.
