I don't have any garden profile data set up yet, so before I can create a front yard design, I need to learn about your space. Let me ask some key questions:

**About your property:**
1. Where are you located (city/state or USDA zone)?
2. What are the approximate dimensions of your front yard? (width along the street × depth from street to house)
3. What's the sun exposure like — full sun, partial shade, or mostly shaded?
4. What existing features are there? (walkway, driveway, porch, trees, lawn, foundation plantings, utility boxes, etc.)

**About your goals:**
5. Any style preference? (e.g., tidy/formal, cottage/lush, modern/minimalist, naturalistic)
6. What's your gardening experience level and how much maintenance are you up for?
7. Any specific edible plants you're excited about, or ones you definitely don't want?

**About conditions:**
8. Do you know your soil type? (clay, sandy, loamy, no idea)
9. Do you have irrigation, or will you hand-water?

The more detail you share, the better the design will be — but answer whatever you can and we'll work with it!

Saved: none — gathering site information before creating profile and design.
