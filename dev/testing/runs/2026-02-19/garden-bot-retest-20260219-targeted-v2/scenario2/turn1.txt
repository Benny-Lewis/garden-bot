No garden profile set up yet, so I don't have your zone, location, or plant history on file. Before I diagnose, I need to understand your growing situation — **a few quick questions:**

1. **Are these seedlings indoors (under lights / on a windowsill) or outdoors?**
2. **Are they in containers or in the ground?** If containers, what size and what soil/mix?
3. **How old are the seedlings, and how big are they?** (e.g., just got true leaves, 6 inches tall, etc.)
4. **Watering routine?** How often, how much, and does the container drain well?
5. **Any fertilizing?** If so, what and how often?
6. **What's your location / USDA zone?** (helps me check if timing is a factor)

The combination of **yellow lower leaves + dark brown concentric ring spots** is a strong visual clue — I have a likely suspect in mind — but the growing conditions will help me confirm whether it's a disease, a nutrient issue, or something environmental. **Please share what you can and I'll give you a solid diagnosis with extension-service sources.**
