`? Insight -------------------------------------`
**Iteration discipline in practice:** The skill requires showing a preview before saving, then saving all related files (SVG, area `.md`, log, calendar) after approval. This ensures the visual and text always agree — the area file's zone summary matches what's in the SVG, and the calendar captures the physical tasks needed to make the design real.
