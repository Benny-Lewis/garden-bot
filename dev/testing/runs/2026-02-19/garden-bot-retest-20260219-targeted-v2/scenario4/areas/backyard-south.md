### Zone Summary
- **Fire pit (east side):** Relocated from west to east, keeping heat/smoke away from planting beds
- **Raised beds (west side):** Reduced from 4 to 2, stacked vertically on the west side — good afternoon sun exposure
- **Seating (center-south):** Unchanged, near patio with clear paths to fire pit and beds

### Key Decisions
- **Fire pit moved east** to separate it from growing areas and open up the west side
- **Beds reduced from 4 to 2** to simplify maintenance and free up space
