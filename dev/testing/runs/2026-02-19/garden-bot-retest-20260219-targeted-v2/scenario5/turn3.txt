I understand you want to move forward, but I'm stuck — the earlier conversation where we discussed your side yard dimensions and designed Options A and B was lost to context compression, and no preview files were saved to disk. I genuinely don't have the design to save.

I need you to fill in the gaps so I can reconstruct it quickly:

1. **Side yard dimensions** (length x width)
2. **Sun exposure** (shade, part shade, full sun)
3. **What's on the west edge** you want screened (neighbor, road, etc.)
4. **Any specific plants or features** you remember from Option B

With even brief answers I can rebuild the design and get you an SVG preview fast.

Saved: none (missing design context from compressed conversation)
