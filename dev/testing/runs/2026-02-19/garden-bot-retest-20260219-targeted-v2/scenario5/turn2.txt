I'm sorry — it looks like the earlier part of our conversation (where we discussed dimensions, your property details, and the two design options) was lost to context compression. There are no saved files in your working directory yet (no `profile.md`, no `areas/`, no preview SVGs), so I don't have a record of what Options A and B looked like.

To regenerate the Option B preview with increased west-edge evergreen screening, I need to catch back up on a few things:

1. **Side yard dimensions** — length and width?
2. **Which side of the house** — north, south, east, or west facing?
3. **Sun exposure** — full sun, part shade, mostly shade?
4. **What's on the west edge** — fence, neighbor's house, road? And what are you screening from?

If you remember the key elements from the earlier options, that would help too — otherwise I'll draft a fresh PNW-native/Japanese-influenced design based on your preferences (low maintenance, heavy evergreen screening on the west).

Saved: none (recovering lost context)
