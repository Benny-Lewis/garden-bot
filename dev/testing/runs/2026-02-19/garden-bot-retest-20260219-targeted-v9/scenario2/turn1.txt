Great — I can see you have a good profile set up. Here's what I know from your records:

- **Location:** Portland, OR (Zone 8b, last frost ~Apr 15)
- **Tomatoes:** Mixed slicer types, 12 seedlings in the south raised bed
- **Transplanted outdoors:** Feb 18 (just 3 days ago)
- **Soil:** Clay loam

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
Your symptoms — **yellow lower leaves + dark brown concentric ("target") spots** — are a classic presentation of **Early Blight** (*Alternaria solani*). The concentric ring pattern is sometimes called "bull's-eye" spotting and is highly characteristic. However, cold stress, transplant shock, and overwatering can mimic or worsen similar symptoms, so context matters before confirming.

Before I confirm a diagnosis, I need to clarify a few things about the growing situation:

1. **Are the seedlings currently outdoors in the raised bed, or still inside under lights?** (Your log says transplanted Feb 18 — that's very early for Portland, well before last frost.)

2. **How are you watering?** Overhead watering, drip, or hand-watering at the base? How often?

3. **Are the spots only on the lowest leaves, or are they spreading upward?**

4. **Did you notice the spots before or after transplanting?** (i.e., did they appear indoors or only after going outside?)

These details will help me distinguish between Early Blight, cold/transplant stress, or another fungal issue — and tailor the right treatment plan for your situation.
