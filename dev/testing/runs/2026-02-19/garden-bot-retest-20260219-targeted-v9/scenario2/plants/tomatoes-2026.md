# Tomatoes 2026
- Variety: mixed slicer types
- Location: backyard south raised bed
- Date planted: 2026-02-10
- Notes: seedlings started indoors then transplanted

## Issues
- 2026-02-21: Early Blight (Alternaria spp.) diagnosed. Yellow lower leaves with dark brown concentric "bull's-eye" spots progressing upward. Contributing factors: overhead evening watering, cool wet weather, early transplant (well before Apr 15 last frost).

## Treatment Plan
- Prune affected lower leaves; sanitize pruners between cuts; trash clippings
- Switch from overhead to base watering, morning only
- Mulch 2-3 inches straw/bark around base to block soil-splash
- Apply liquid copper fungicide (Bonide Liquid Copper or Liqui-Cop) every 7-10 days during wet/cool weather
- Use row cover or cloches at night until frost risk passes (~Apr 15)
- Light feeding: fish emulsion or half-rate 10-10-10
- Stake/cage for airflow as plants grow
- End-of-season: remove all debris; rotate solanaceous crops out of this bed for 3-4 years
