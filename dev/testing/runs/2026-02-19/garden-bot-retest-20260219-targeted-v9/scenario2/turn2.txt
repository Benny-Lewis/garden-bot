**Log** — Feb 21 entry recorded with diagnosis details and treatment summary.

The most important thing you can do **today** is prune those spotted lower leaves, stop the overhead watering, and get mulch down. That alone will dramatically slow the spread. The copper spray tomorrow will protect the new growth going forward.
