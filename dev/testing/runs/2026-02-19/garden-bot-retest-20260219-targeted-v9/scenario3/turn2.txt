## Option A — Layered Native

Naturalistic layers within clean bed lines. Maximum stealth-edible coverage.

| Zone | Plants | Stealth-Edible Role |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| Foundation (left) | Rosemary (3) + alpine strawberry groundcover | Herb harvest + fruit, looks like a tidy border |
| Foundation (right) | Evergreen huckleberry (3) | Native berry shrub, reads as boxwood |
| Upper left bed | **Amelanchier (serviceberry)** focal tree + salal + sword fern | Native tree with spring bloom, fall fruit, great form |
| Upper right bed | Oregon grape (Mahonia) group | Native, yellow flowers, blue berries, evergreen |
| Mid left | Kinnikinnick mat | Native groundcover, red berries, no mow |
| Mid right | Creeping thyme panel | Fragrant edible groundcover |
| Lower left | **Blueberry hedge (3 cultivars)** | Spring flowers, summer fruit, fall color |
| Lower right | Deschampsia + gaura | Native grass texture + airy perennial |
| Curb strip left | Compact Oregon grape mass | Evergreen, edible, tough |
| Curb strip right | Deschampsia cespitosa | Native tufted hairgrass |

**Tradeoffs:** Nearly zero lawn. More diverse, more seasonal interest, more harvest. Higher establishment effort. Slightly less "clean" read from the street — layered rather than geometric.

## Option B — Structured Modern

Geometric blocks, gravel mulch, strong architectural lines. Fewer species, bolder impact.

| Zone | Plants | Stealth-Edible Role |
|------|--------|---------------------|
| Foundation (both sides) | Clipped evergreen huckleberry hedge | Continuous edible hedge reads as formal boxwood |
| Left main bed | **Blueberry trio** ('Duke', 'Pink Lemonade', 'Sunshine Blue') in gravel + basalt boulder | Sculptural fruit shrubs on gravel = modern gallery feel |
| Right feature bed | Rosemary standards (2) + lavender 'Hidcote' underplanting | Formal topiary-style edible herbs |
| Right lower | Clipped Mahonia gracilis hedge | Compact native Oregon grape, edible |
| Lawn panels | Fine fescue (native blend) | Low-mow, stays green, clean lines |
| Curb strip | Deschampsia cespitosa mass + basalt stepping stones | Uniform native grass, clean infrastructure |

**Tradeoffs:** Retains some lawn (easier care, cleaner look). Fewer edible species but strong "designed" curb appeal. Gravel mulch + basalt = higher material cost upfront. The clipped hedges need 2-3 trims per year.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- **Evergreen huckleberry** (Vaccinium ovatum) is the ultimate Portland stealth edible — it's native, evergreen, takes clipping like boxwood, produces sweet berries, and has zero pest issues in Zone 8b. It appears in both options because it's that good.
- **Blueberries in gravel mulch** (Option B) is a modern design trick: the gray gravel makes the green foliage and fall reds pop, while keeping the acidic soil conditions blueberries need (gravel doesn't shift pH like limestone).

**Which direction do you prefer — A (layered, max diversity), B (geometric, bold simplicity), or elements from both?**
