`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Design-to-data pipeline**: The approved design was decomposed into structured data across multiple files — the layout SVG is the spatial truth, `side-yard.md` captures the *why* behind each zone, individual plant files record care-relevant details, `calendar.md` sequences the build/plant actions, and the log records the decision. This separation means any future question ("when do I plant the vine maple?" or "what's in the east entry?") can be answered from the right file without re-reading the whole design.

Option B — Contemplation Garden is now your canonical design. All files saved:

- **Layout:** `areas/side-yard-layout.svg` — canonical visual with all zones, labels, and legend
- **Area:** `areas/side-yard.md` — updated with full design section, zone summary, and key decisions
- **Plants:** `plants/vine-maple.md`, `plants/oregon-grape.md`, `plants/sword-fern.md`, `plants/salal.md`, `plants/deer-fern.md`, `plants/wild-ginger.md`
- **Calendar:** `calendar.md` — 10 action items from March sourcing through May establishment check
- **Log:** `log/2026-02.md` — design session recorded
