**PNW Native + Japanese fusion**: This style pairs beautifully in Portland's Zone 8b climate. PNW natives (sword fern, Oregon grape, vine maple) thrive naturally, while Japanese garden principles — asymmetry, enclosure, borrowed scenery, and moss/stone ground planes — give structure to a narrow 24×8 ft corridor. The key is translating "style words" into concrete spatial choices.

Great — I have your existing side yard data. Here's what I know:

- **Location:** Portland, OR (Zone 8b)
- **Dimensions:** 24 × 8 ft east-west corridor, partial shade
- **Existing:** Narrow path, fence on north edge
- **Style:** PNW native with Japanese influence

Before I draft two layout options, I need a few details:

1. **South edge** — is there a house wall, another fence, or open to a neighbor? And roughly how tall is the north fence?
2. **Access** — do you enter from the east end, west end, or both? Is this a pass-through corridor or a destination space?
3. **Sun direction** — you noted partial shade; is the shade from the house (south side), the fence, or overhead trees?
4. **Must-haves vs. nice-to-haves** — any of these important to you?
   - Seating/pause spot
   - Water feature (basin, tsukubai)
   - Screening for privacy
   - Stepping stone path vs. a wider walkable surface

These answers will let me place zones accurately in the two preview SVGs.
