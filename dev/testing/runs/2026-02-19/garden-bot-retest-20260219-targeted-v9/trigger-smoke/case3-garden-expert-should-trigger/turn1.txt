`? Insight -------------------------------------`
The powdery white coating on cucumbers is a classic symptom presentation, but the skill requires gathering growing context before diagnosing — environmental conditions significantly affect both the likely cause and the right treatment approach.

I found your profile — you're in **Portland, OR (Zone 8b)** with **clay loam soil**. I don't see cucumbers tracked yet in your garden files, so I have a few questions to narrow this down before I give you a diagnosis:

1. **Indoor or outdoor?** Are these cucumbers growing outside in the ground/raised bed, or in containers (possibly indoors or in a greenhouse)?
2. **Watering routine?** How often are you watering, and are you watering overhead (sprinkler/hose on leaves) or at the base?
3. **Sun exposure?** Full sun, partial shade, or mostly shaded?
4. **How widespread?** Is the white coating on just a few leaves (older or younger ones?), or across the whole plant?
5. **Any recent changes?** New weather pattern, nearby plantings, fertilizer applied, etc.?

These details will help me confirm the diagnosis and give you the most effective treatment plan for your specific situation.
