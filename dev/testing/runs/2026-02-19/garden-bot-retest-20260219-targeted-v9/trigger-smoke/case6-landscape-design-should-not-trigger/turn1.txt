I can see your garden profile — you're in Portland, OR (Zone 8b) with clay loam soil, a backyard with patio and lawn, a south-facing front yard, and roses in the front. Your February log has one baseline entry so far.

Before I record today's notes, I need a few details from you:

1. **Watering** — What did you water today? (e.g., front yard, backyard, roses specifically?) How much / how long?
2. **Fertilizer** — What product or type did you apply? (e.g., 10-10-10, fish emulsion, compost tea?) Where did you apply it, and how much?
3. **Any observations?** — Anything you noticed while out there (soil moisture, plant condition, weather)?

Share whatever details you have and I'll get it logged.
