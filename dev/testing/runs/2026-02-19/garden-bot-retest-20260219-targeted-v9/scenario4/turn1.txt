Both previews should be open in Chrome. Here's the comparison:

### Option A — Full Swap
- **Fire pit** → east side
- **2 raised beds** → west side (where fire pit was)
- **Seating** → centered near patio
- **Tradeoff**: Balanced layout; beds get afternoon sun from the south-west. Fire pit is away from beds, reducing heat/smoke risk to plants.

### Option B — Beds Stay East
- **Fire pit** → east side (south-east corner)
- **2 raised beds** → east side (north-east corner, above fire pit)
- **Seating** → shifted west near patio
- **Tradeoff**: Keeps growing area on the east (morning sun advantage). Opens up the entire west side as flexible space. But fire pit and beds share the east half — tighter spacing.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Sun exposure matters for bed placement**: In Portland (Zone 8b), beds on the west side (Option A) get strong afternoon sun — great for tomatoes and heat-lovers, but can stress cool-season greens in summer. East-side beds (Option B) get gentler morning sun, which is ideal for lettuce and herbs. Your crop plan should drive which option you pick.
