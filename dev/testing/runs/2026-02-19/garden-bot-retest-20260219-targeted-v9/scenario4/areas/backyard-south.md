### Zone summary
- **West side — 2 raised beds (4×3 ft each)**: Swapped from east to west. Afternoon sun exposure suits warm-season crops (tomatoes, peppers). Stacked vertically with a walkway between them.
- **East side — Fire pit**: Moved from west to east. Separated from beds to avoid heat/smoke damage to plants. Ample clearance from plot boundary.
- **Center-south — Seating area**: Near patio with clear sightlines to both the fire pit and beds.

### Key decisions
- **Full swap layout** chosen over keeping beds east — balances the space evenly and gives beds strong afternoon sun while isolating the fire pit from planting areas.
- **Reduced from 4 beds to 2** to simplify maintenance and open up circulation space.
