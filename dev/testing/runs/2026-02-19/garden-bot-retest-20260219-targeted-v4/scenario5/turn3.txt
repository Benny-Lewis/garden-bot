`? Insight -------------------------------------`
The side yard design reuses three species from the front yard (vine maple, salal, sword fern), which creates visual continuity across the property — a key principle in residential landscape design. The new species (Oregon oxalis, red huckleberry, deer fern) are all native shade-tolerant plants that distinguish this area's character while staying within the PNW palette.
