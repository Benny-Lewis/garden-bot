`? Insight -------------------------------------`
Your front yard is already a well-developed PNW native design with stealth edibles. The side yard is a new area not yet in your profile. "PNW native with Japanese influence" is a natural pairing — both traditions value understory layering, moss, ferns, and restrained elegance. The key design tension will be how literal vs. subtle the Japanese elements are.

Great — I can see your Portland 8b profile, your front yard design, and your existing plant palette. The side yard isn't in your areas yet, so I need to understand the space.

First question: **What are the dimensions and conditions of this side yard?** Specifically:

- Which side of the house (left or right as you face it from the street)?
- Rough dimensions (length × width)?
- Sun exposure — full shade, part shade, or does it get some direct sun?
- Any existing features (fence, gate, AC unit, utility meters, neighbor's structure close by)?
