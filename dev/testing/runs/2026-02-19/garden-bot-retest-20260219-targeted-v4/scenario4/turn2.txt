The user said "Looks good. Approved: save this update now." But there's nothing to save — my previous response was a clarification question explaining that the current front yard design has no fire pit or raised beds. No new layout was generated, no modifications were made. The user may have misread my response.

There's nothing to save yet — my last message was a clarification question, not a design update. The current front yard layout doesn't have a fire pit or raised beds, so I couldn't make the changes you requested.

To move forward, I need to know:

1. **Which area** has the fire pit and raised beds? (A backyard, side yard, etc.)
2. **What are the dimensions** of that area?

If this is a new area you'd like to design from scratch with a fire pit and 2 raised beds, just give me the space details and I'll draft options.

Saved: none - no design changes to save
