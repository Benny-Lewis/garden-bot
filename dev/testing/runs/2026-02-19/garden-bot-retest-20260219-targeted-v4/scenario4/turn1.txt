I've reviewed your current front yard design and I don't see a fire pit or raised beds in the existing layout. The current design has:

- **Left bed** (13' × 11') — native woodland vignette
- **Right bed** (11.5' × 11') — edible production
- **Foundation strip** — rosemary hedge
- **Planting strip** — serviceberry + native sedge

There's no fire pit to move, and the beds aren't raised beds — they're ground-level planting beds.

Are you referring to a different area (like a backyard) that I don't have files for yet? Or would you like to modify this front yard design in a different way? If you have a backyard or other area with a fire pit and raised beds, let me know the dimensions and I'll pull it up.

Saved: none - clarification needed
