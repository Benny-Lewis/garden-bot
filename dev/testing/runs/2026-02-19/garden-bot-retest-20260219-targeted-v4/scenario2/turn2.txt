All recorded. Here's a quick summary of the time-based follow-ups now in your calendar:

| When | Action |
|------|--------|
| **Today (Feb 19)** | Remove infected leaves, switch to base watering, mulch bed |
| **Feb 26** | First copper fungicide application |
| **March (ongoing)** | Copper spray every 7–10 days; weekly leaf inspections |
| **2028 season** | Earliest to plant tomatoes/peppers/potatoes in this bed again |

The single biggest thing you can do right now is **stop the overhead evening watering** — that overnight leaf wetness is fueling the fungus more than anything else.
