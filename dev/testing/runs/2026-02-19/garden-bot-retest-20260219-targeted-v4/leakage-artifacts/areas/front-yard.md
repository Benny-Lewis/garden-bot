# Front Yard

## Site
- **Dimensions:** 30' wide × 15' deep (house to sidewalk)
- **Orientation:** South-facing
- **Sun:** Full sun (6+ hours)
- **Walkway:** 4' wide, straight, door slightly right of center
- **Foundation strip:** 2' deep along house
- **Planting strip:** 5' wide between sidewalk and curb

## Design

![Layout](front-yard-layout.svg)

**Style:** Clean modern PNW native with stealth edibles

### Zone Summary

**Left bed (13' × 11')** — Native woodland vignette. Vine maple (multi-stem) as focal tree creates dappled canopy and fall color. Red flowering currant for spring bloom and hummingbirds (edible berries). Salal for evergreen mid-layer (edible berries). Sword fern for textural understory. This bed anchors the left side and frames the sightline to the front door.

**Right bed (11.5' × 11')** — Edible production bed disguised as ornamental. Fig 'Desert King' as bold architectural focal tree (reliable Portland breba crop). Four blueberries underneath for structure, fall color, and fruit. Creeping thyme groundcover ties it together and is harvestable. Placed on the right to keep the door approach open from the walkway.

**Foundation strip (2' deep)** — Continuous rosemary hedge for evergreen structure and cooking herbs. Oregon grape at transition points for native texture and edible berries. Frames the house cleanly.

**Planting strip (5' × 30')** — Western serviceberry (native + edible) as a street tree on the right side. Native sedge (Carex pensylvanica) groundcover throughout — no-mow, low water once established.

### Key Decisions
- **Vine maple over serviceberry for the main yard focal:** Vine maple gives stronger multi-season structure and shade development; serviceberry moved to planting strip where it serves as street-level focal
- **Fig 'Desert King' chosen over other fruit trees:** Desert King produces reliable breba crop in Portland's climate; bold leaf shape reads as intentional landscaping, not orchard
- **Near-zero lawn:** Maximizes planting density and eliminates mowing; narrow lawn strip beside walkway is functional buffer only
- **Edible plants integrated, not segregated:** Every zone contains at least one edible species, but none reads as "vegetable garden"

### Optional Ideas
- Understory bulbs (camas, native alliums) in left bed for spring interest
- Pathway lighting along walkway
- Small boulder or art piece at left bed front corner
