# Garden Log — February 2026

## 2026-02-19 — Tomato Early Blight Diagnosed

**Location:** Backyard raised bed
**Diagnosis:** Early blight (*Alternaria solani*) — yellow lower leaves with concentric-ring brown spots, progressing upward. Triggered by cool wet weather + overhead evening watering.
**Actions taken:** Remove infected leaves, switch to morning base watering, mulch, begin copper fungicide spray program.
**Follow-ups:** Copper every 7–10 days through March; weekly leaf inspections.

## 2026-02-19 — Front Yard Design Approved

**Design:** "Native Tapestry" — clean modern PNW native with stealth edibles

**Layout:** Four zones across a 30' × 15' south-facing front yard:
- Left bed (13' × 11'): Vine maple focal + red flowering currant, salal, sword fern
- Right bed (11.5' × 11'): Fig 'Desert King' focal + blueberries ×4, creeping thyme
- Foundation (2' strip): Rosemary hedge ×8 + Oregon grape ×2
- Planting strip (5' × 30'): Western serviceberry + native sedge groundcover

**Edible species (8):** Fig, blueberry, rosemary, thyme, serviceberry, salal, red flowering currant, Oregon grape

**Next steps:** Source plants, soil test (especially pH for blueberry bed), begin bed prep in March.

## 2026-02-19 — Side Yard Design Approved

**Design:** "Woodland Corridor" — PNW native with Japanese influence through restraint and simplicity

**Layout:** Two zones across a 24' × 8' east–west corridor (partial shade, fence on north):
- Planting bed (24' × 5.5', north band): Vine maple focal + salal ×3 along fence, sword fern ×3, red huckleberry, deer fern, Oregon oxalis groundcover, boulder at east entry
- Path (24' × 2.5', south edge): Pea gravel walkway along house wall

**Edible species (2):** Red huckleberry, salal

**Key choices:** Oregon oxalis over moss (more forgiving); Japanese influence expressed through restraint/clean groundplane rather than literal materials; red huckleberry continues stealth-edibles philosophy.

**Next steps:** Source side yard plants alongside front yard order; prep path in March; plant in April.
