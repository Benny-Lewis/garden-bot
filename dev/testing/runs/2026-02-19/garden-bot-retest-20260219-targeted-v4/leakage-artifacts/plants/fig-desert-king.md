# Fig 'Desert King' (Ficus carica 'Desert King')

- **Type:** Deciduous fruit tree
- **Location:** Front yard, right bed (focal)
- **Size:** 8–10' tall × 8' wide (can be kept smaller with pruning)
- **Sun:** Full sun required
- **Edible:** Large green figs, reliable breba crop (June–July) on previous year's wood
- **Interest:** Bold tropical-looking palmate leaves, sculptural winter branching
- **Role:** Architectural focal point + primary fruit production
- **Care:** Protect from hard freezes (<15°F) with burlap wrap; prune minimally to preserve breba wood; feed in spring
- **Why Desert King:** Most reliable fig for Portland — produces on breba crop which doesn't need the long hot season that main crop requires
