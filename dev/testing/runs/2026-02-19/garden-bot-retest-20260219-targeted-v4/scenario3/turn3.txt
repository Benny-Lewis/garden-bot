Design saved. Here's what's committed:

**Native Tapestry — your approved front yard design** with 8 stealth edible species woven through 4 zones, maintaining a clear sightline to the door via the walkway corridor.

`? Insight -------------------------------------`
- **Blueberry soil prep is the critical path item.** Portland soil is typically pH 5.5–6.5, but blueberries need 4.5–5.5. Start the soil test now — sulfur takes weeks to lower pH, so February isn't too early.
- **'Desert King' fig is uniquely suited to Portland** because it fruits on the breba crop (last year's wood), not the main crop. Most fig varieties need a longer, hotter summer than Portland provides. Protect the previous year's growth from hard freezes and you get reliable fruit.
- **Your immediate action items** are in the calendar: source plants and get a soil test this month, then begin bed prep in March after last frost.
