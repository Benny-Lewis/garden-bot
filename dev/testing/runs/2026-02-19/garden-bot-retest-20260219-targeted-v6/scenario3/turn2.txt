Both layouts should be open in Chrome now. Here's a summary of each:

---

## Option A: Structured Modern

Two **symmetric rectangular beds** flanking the walkway with clean edges.

| Zone | Plants |
|------|--------|
| **Foundation** | Upright rosemary + purple sage (herbs that read as ornamentals) |
| **Left bed** (larger) | **Western serviceberry** focal tree, **blueberry** cluster (3), native sedge mass |
| **Right bed** | **Evergreen huckleberry** (2) + **Oregon grape** (2) — all-native, all-evergreen |
| **Bed edging** | Creeping thyme (left), alpine strawberry (right) |
| **Planting strip** | Lavender + Idaho fescue alternating |

## Option B: Asymmetric Drift

**Unequal massing** — large planted bed left, smaller accent bed + thyme lawn right.

| Zone | Plants |
|------|--------|
| **Foundation** | Sword fern + rosemary alternating (shade-tolerant near house) |
| **Left bed** (dominant) | **Serviceberry** focal tree shifted forward, **blueberries** (4) wrapping around it, **Oregon grape** near sidewalk, native sedge drift |
| **Right bed** (compact) | Purple sage + lavender mass |
| **Right open area** | **Creeping thyme lawn** — walkable, fragrant, no mowing |
| **Walkway border** | Alpine strawberry on both sides |
| **Planting strip** | **Evergreen huckleberry hedge** — year-round screening |

## Tradeoffs

| | Option A | Option B |
|---|---------|---------|
| **Curb appeal style** | Balanced, tidy, conventional "nice yard" | More dynamic, designer feel, eye-catching |
| **Edible yield** | Moderate — spread across both beds | Higher — concentrated blueberry mass + huckleberry hedge |
| **Maintenance** | Even on both sides, straightforward | Left bed needs more attention; right thyme lawn is near zero |
| **Winter interest** | Good — huckleberry + Oregon grape evergreen on right | Better — huckleberry hedge gives year-round street-side presence |
| **Lawn replacement** | Full — no turf remaining | Full — thyme lawn replaces turf on right |

`? Insight -------------------------------------`
- All edibles were chosen to "pass" as ornamentals — blueberries have great fall color, serviceberry has spring blooms, huckleberry is a classic PNW hedge plant. Neighbors won't notice it's a food garden.
- Every plant is proven in Portland Zone 8b. Serviceberry and Oregon grape are Willamette Valley natives.
- The planting strip is public ROW — Option B's huckleberry hedge there gives more yield from space you don't fully control.
