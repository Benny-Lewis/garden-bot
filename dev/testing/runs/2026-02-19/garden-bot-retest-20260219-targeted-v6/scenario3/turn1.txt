`? Insight -------------------------------------`
Portland Zone 8b is excellent for edible landscaping — the mild maritime climate supports a wide range of ornamental edibles year-round. South-facing at 30x15 ft means strong sun exposure, which opens up fruit and herb options that wouldn't work on a north-facing lot.

I've got your profile — **Portland, OR (Zone 8b), 30×15 ft south-facing front yard** with lawn and a walkway to the front door. Great starting point for an edible curb appeal design.

Before I create layout options, I need a few details to get the spatial design right:

1. **Walkway position** — Does your walkway run up the center of the yard, or is it offset to one side? Straight or curved?

2. **How much lawn do you want to keep?** Options range from "replace it all" to "keep a small strip of green."

3. **Style preference** — Any of these appeal to you?
   - **Cottage garden** (lush, layered, informal)
   - **Modern/clean** (structured beds, defined edges, minimalist)
   - **PNW naturalistic** (native-forward, relaxed, low-maintenance)
   - Something else?

4. **Effort level** — Are you up for moderate ongoing maintenance, or do you want mostly set-and-forget plantings?
