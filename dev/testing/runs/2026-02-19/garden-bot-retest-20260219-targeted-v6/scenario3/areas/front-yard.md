# Front Yard

- Dimensions: 30 ft wide × 15 ft deep
- Orientation: South-facing, full sun
- Walkway: Straight, 4 ft wide, door slightly right of center
- Foundation strip: 2 ft along house
- Planting strip: 5 ft between sidewalk and curb (city ROW)

## Design: Asymmetric Drift

![Layout](front-yard-layout.svg)

### Zone Summary

**Style: Clean modern PNW native** — structured asymmetry with native and edible plants that read as ornamentals. The larger left bed anchors the composition with a focal tree and berry mass; the right side stays open with a thyme lawn, preserving a clear sightline to the front door.

| Zone | Plants | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Foundation (2 ft)** | Sword fern + upright rosemary, alternating | Evergreen base, softens house wall; rosemary is stealth edible |
| **Left bed (14 ft × 13 ft)** | Western serviceberry (focal tree), 4 blueberries, 2 Oregon grape, native sedge drift | Primary mass — layered heights, year-round interest, high edible yield |
| **Right accent bed (12 ft × 7 ft)** | Purple sage + lavender mass | Fragrant, pollinator-friendly, culinary herbs that look ornamental |
| **Right open area (12 ft × 6 ft)** | Creeping thyme lawn | Walkable groundcover, no mowing, fragrant when stepped on |
| **Walkway borders** | Alpine strawberry | Low edging, fruit from spring through fall |
| **Planting strip (30 ft × 5 ft)** | Evergreen huckleberry hedge (5 plants) | Year-round screening, native, edible berries in summer |

### Key Decisions

- **Asymmetric layout** chosen over symmetric to create a more dynamic modern feel while keeping the door visible from the street
- **Serviceberry as focal tree** — spring white blooms, edible June berries, brilliant fall color; stays under 20 ft so it won't overwhelm a 15 ft deep yard
- **Huckleberry in the planting strip** rather than the main yard — maximizes edible yield from city ROW space that's otherwise wasted on grass
- **Thyme lawn on right** — maintains an open, inviting feel on the approach side while eliminating turf maintenance
- **All edibles chosen for ornamental value** — "stealth edible" strategy so the front yard reads as a designed landscape, not a food garden
