# Tomatoes 2026

## Status
- Started: indoors under grow lights, cell trays
- Watering: overhead, every other day
- Issue (2026-02-15 approx): Early blight (Alternaria solani) diagnosed on seedlings — yellow lower leaves with concentric brown ring spots, spreading upward

## Early Blight Management Plan
1. **Switch to bottom-watering immediately** — overhead watering splashes spores from soil to leaves
2. **Remove affected lower leaves** — dispose of them, do not compost
3. **Improve air circulation** — add a small fan near trays, increase spacing between seedlings
4. **Reduce humidity** — let soil surface dry between waterings
5. **Consider copper fungicide** if spots continue spreading after cultural changes
6. **When transplanting outdoors** (after mid-April):
   - Mulch heavily to prevent soil splash
   - Space plants widely for airflow
   - Continue bottom-watering or drip irrigation
   - Choose early blight-resistant varieties for future plantings (look for "EB" designation in seed catalogs)
