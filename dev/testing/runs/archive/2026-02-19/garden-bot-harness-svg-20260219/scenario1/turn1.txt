No profile set up yet — just a starter calendar. Welcome to Portland! Great gardening city. Before I create your profile and area files, I'd love to learn a bit more so the tracking is actually useful from day one.

You've given me a solid start — zone 8b, south-facing front yard (30x15), backyard (40x30) with a mature oak and patio. A few questions:

1. **Gardening experience & goals** — Are you an experienced gardener or just getting started? What are you hoping to do with the space — food production, native/pollinator habitat, ornamentals, low-maintenance landscaping, some mix?

2. **Soil & drainage** — Do you know anything about the soil yet? Portland soils range from heavy clay (very common) to silty loam depending on the neighborhood. Have you dug into it at all? Does water pool anywhere in winter?

3. **Existing plants** — Beyond the oak, is there anything else already growing — shrubs, perennials, ground cover? Or is it basically lawn + oak + patio?

4. **Water situation** — Do you have hose bibs in both front and back? Any irrigation, or hand-watering for now?

5. **Sun on the backyard** — That oak on the north half is interesting. How much shade does it cast over the south half of the backyard in summer? (This will really shape what you can grow back there.)

No need to answer everything perfectly — even rough impressions help me set up a profile that's actually useful rather than generic.
