### Zone Summary
- West — Growing zone: two 10×5 ft raised beds with a walking path between them. West placement captures strong afternoon sun, ideal for vegetables.
- East — Fire pit lounge: centered fire pit with surrounding seating area. Naturally shaded by evening, comfortable for fire-lit gatherings.

### Key Decisions
- Fire pit moved from west to east for better evening ambiance (shaded by dusk).
- Raised beds reduced from 4 to 2 and moved west to maximize afternoon sun exposure for growing.
