Here's the updated layout for your review:

### What changed
| | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| **Fire pit** | West side | **East side** |
| **Raised beds** | 4 beds, east | **2 beds, west** |
| **Bed size** | — | 10×5 ft each |

### Spatial notes
- **West / Growing Zone** — Two raised beds stacked vertically with a walking path between them. Gets strong afternoon sun (ideal for vegetables in Portland).
- **East / Fire Pit Lounge** — Fire pit centered with a seating ring around it. Shaded by evening, which is comfortable when the fire is going.
- A dashed green line marks the zone boundary roughly at the midpoint.

Does this look right before I save the design files? Anything you'd adjust — bed sizes, spacing, fire pit position within the east zone?

Once confirmed, I'll update the area file, backyard overview, and calendar.
