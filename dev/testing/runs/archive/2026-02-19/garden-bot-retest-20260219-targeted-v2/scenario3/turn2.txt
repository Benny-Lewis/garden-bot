Great details — the walkway, foundation strip, and planting strip give me good structure to work with. Before I can draw accurate SVGs, I need a few more measurements:

**Must-have for the layout:**
1. **Overall front yard dimensions** — approximate width (along the street) and depth (street/sidewalk to house)?
2. **Driveway** — is there one? If so, which side and how wide?
3. **Sun exposure** — full sun, part shade, or varies across the yard?

**Helpful for plant selection:**
4. **Where in PNW?** (City or USDA zone — e.g., Seattle is 8b, Portland is 8b, east of Cascades is quite different)
5. **Existing trees or large shrubs** to keep?

Once I have the yard footprint I'll generate two SVG options — one with a more structured/symmetrical approach and one with a naturalistic asymmetric layout — both integrating stealth edibles with PNW natives.

Saved: none — waiting for dimensions before generating layouts.
