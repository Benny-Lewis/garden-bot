Both SVG previews should be opening in your browser now. Here's the breakdown:

## Option A — Layered Native Grove

A naturalistic, layered design anchored by a **western serviceberry** (Amelanchier alnifolia) as a small multi-stem tree on the west side, with understory of evergreen huckleberry, salal, and kinnikinnick.

**Plant list:**
| Plant | Role | Edible? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Western Serviceberry | Anchor tree, 10-15 ft | Yes — June berries | Spring white flowers, fall color |
| Evergreen Huckleberry (×2) | Mid-layer shrub | Yes — Aug-Oct berries | Glossy evergreen, bronze new growth |
| Salal | Low evergreen mass | Yes — berries (subtle) | Classic PNW native groundcover |
| Blueberry (×3) | East bed cluster | Yes — summer fruit | Blazing fall color |
| Kinnikinnick | Groundcover | Mildly | Evergreen mat, pink flowers |
| Creeping Thyme | Groundcover/strip | Yes — culinary herb | Fragrant, walkable |
| Rosemary | Foundation | Yes — culinary | Evergreen structure |
| Lavender | Foundation | Culinary/tea | Pollinator magnet |
| Sword Fern | Foundation (west) | No | Evergreen native texture |
| Low Oregon Grape (×3) | Planting strip | Yes — tart berries | Oregon state flower, evergreen |

**Pros:** High biodiversity, year-round seasonal interest, strong native habitat value, serviceberry gives vertical drama. Most visitors won't realize 80% of the yard is edible.

**Cons:** Takes 2-3 years to fill in. Serviceberry drops berries on walkway if not sited carefully. More organic/less tidy look — depends on maintenance.

## Option B — Modern Edible Hedgerow

A cleaner, more geometric layout with **formal blueberry hedge** on the west side, a dedicated **herb panel** near the street, and a **clipped evergreen huckleberry hedge** in the planting strip.

**Plant list:**
| Plant | Role | Edible? | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Blueberry (×3) | Formal hedge row | Yes — summer fruit | Brilliant fall color, clipped to 4 ft |
| Evergreen Huckleberry (hedge) | Planting strip screen | Yes — fall berries | Clipped to 3 ft, dense |
| Tall Oregon Grape | East bed accent | Yes — tart berries | Year-round structure, yellow spring bloom |
| Karl Foerster Grass (×2) | Vertical accent | No | Clean modern lines, 5 ft |
| Rosemary, Lavender, Sage, Oregano | Herb panel | Yes — all culinary | Fragrant, textured, low |
| Compact Mahonia (×2) | Foundation | Yes — berries | Evergreen, compact form |
| Kinnikinnick | East groundcover | Mildly | Evergreen mat |
| Woolly Thyme | Blueberry underplanting | Yes | Silver-green mat |
| Cor-ten steel edging | Hardscape detail | — | Modern material accent |

**Pros:** Immediately reads as "designed." Cleaner lines, fewer species to manage. Herb panel is a conversation piece. The huckleberry hedge gives street-side privacy while producing berries nobody recognizes as food.

**Cons:** Fewer species = less habitat. Needs clipping 1-2×/year to stay formal. Karl Foerster grass is non-native (though non-invasive). Less "wild PNW" feel.

## Key Tradeoffs

| | Option A | Option B |
|---|---|---|
| **Stealth edible %** | ~80% of plants | ~70% of plants |
| **Curb appeal timeline** | 2-3 years to fill | Looks finished year 1 |
| **Maintenance** | Lower once established | Regular clipping needed |
| **Native purity** | Nearly 100% native | ~80% native |
| **Style** | Naturalistic PNW | Clean modern |
| **Wildlife value** | Higher | Moderate |

`? Insight -------------------------------------`
Both designs use the "stealth edible" strategy of choosing edibles with strong ornamental qualities. The key insight from [OSU Extension's edible landscaping guide](https://extension.oregonstate.edu/sites/extd8/files/documents/12281/ediblelandscaping.pdf) is that the most successful edible front yards use edibles *as* the structural framework (hedges, anchors, groundcovers) rather than tucking them between ornamentals. Blueberries-as-hedge and huckleberry-as-screen are prime examples — they do the landscape job first and produce food as a bonus.
`-------------------------------------------------`

What catches your eye? I can also mix elements between the two — for example, the serviceberry anchor from A with the formal herb panel from B.
