I can see you have some garden data already — tomatoes in a backyard raised bed with an early blight treatment plan. But there's no profile or front yard area file yet, so I need to learn about your situation before we design.

`? Insight -------------------------------------`
Designing edible front yards for curb appeal is a growing practice called "foodscaping." The key is choosing edibles that double as ornamentals — plants with attractive form, foliage, or flowers — so the yard reads as designed rather than utilitarian. University extension services have great resources on this.
`-------------------------------------------------`

To create a good design, I need to understand your space and preferences. A few questions to start:

1. **Where are you located?** (City/state or USDA zone — this determines what's hardy and when to plant)

2. **Front yard dimensions and layout?** Rough measurements are fine — width across the front, depth from sidewalk/street to house, and which direction the front of your house faces (north, south, etc.)

3. **What's there now?** Existing lawn, trees, shrubs, walkway, driveway? Anything you want to keep vs. remove?

4. **Sun exposure?** Full sun most of the day, partial shade, or mostly shaded?

5. **Style/vibe?** Are you thinking more cottage garden, clean/modern, naturalistic, or something else? Any HOA restrictions?

6. **Edible priorities?** Do you have specific edibles in mind (berries, herbs, fruit trees), or do you want me to suggest the best options for curb appeal in your area?

Take as many of these as you'd like — even partial answers help me start sketching ideas.
