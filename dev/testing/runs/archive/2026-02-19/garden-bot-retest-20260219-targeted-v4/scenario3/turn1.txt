I'd love to help design a front yard that looks great and produces food! I don't have any saved garden profile data yet, so I need to gather some details before I can create a layout.

**To get started, I need to understand your space:**

1. **Where are you located?** (City/state or USDA hardiness zone) — this determines what edibles thrive for you and when to plant them.

2. **Front yard dimensions?** Approximate width (along the street) and depth (street to house), plus which direction the house faces (N/S/E/W). Sun exposure is critical for edible plants.

3. **What's there now?** Lawn, existing trees/shrubs, walkway, driveway position, any features you want to keep?

4. **Style leanings?** You said curb appeal — any vibe? (e.g., cottage garden, clean/modern, naturalistic, traditional foundation planting with a twist)

5. **Any constraints?** HOA rules, budget range, how much maintenance you want, deer/wildlife pressure?

`? Insight -------------------------------------`
Edible landscaping for curb appeal is a design challenge because many productive plants (vegetable rows, raised beds) read as "garden" not "landscape." The trick is using edibles that have strong ornamental qualities — blueberries for fall color, herbs for texture, espaliered fruit trees for structure — and integrating them into a design that reads as intentional landscaping first. Knowing your zone and sun exposure is essential because most edibles need 6+ hours of direct sun.

**Wait for your answers before I start sketching — the details will completely change the design.**
