# Side Yard

## Site
- **Dimensions:** 24' long × 8' wide
- **Orientation:** East–west corridor
- **Sun:** Partial shade
- **Fence:** North edge
- **Path:** 2.5' pea gravel path along south (house) edge

## Design

![Layout](../side-yard-layout.svg)

**Style:** PNW native woodland corridor with Japanese influence — the Japanese sensibility expressed through restraint, clean groundplane, and deliberate simplicity rather than literal Japanese garden materials.

### Zone Summary

**Planting bed (24' × 5.5', north band)** — Layered native woodland. Vine maple (multi-stem) as focal tree at center-west creates dappled canopy, fall color, and graceful winter branching. Salal ×3 along the fence for evergreen screening and mid-layer structure. Sword fern ×3 scattered through the understory for bold texture. Red huckleberry as an edible accent shrub at the east end. Deer fern near the vine maple for fine-textured contrast. Oregon oxalis carpet fills the groundplane — self-spreading, shade-tolerant, clover-like. Single boulder at the east entry as a restrained focal point.

**Path (24' × 2.5', south edge)** — Pea gravel walkway along the house wall. Keeps clear passage through the corridor. Quiet underfoot, low maintenance, drains well.

### Key Decisions
- **Woodland corridor over moss garden:** Oregon oxalis is more forgiving than moss in variable moisture conditions; denser plant layering fills the space faster and reads as established sooner
- **Japanese influence through restraint:** Clean groundplane, single boulder focal, limited palette — the Japanese sensibility is in what's left out, not added
- **Red huckleberry for stealth edibles:** Continues the front yard's edible-integration philosophy; native, shade-tolerant, produces tart berries
- **Pea gravel over stepping stones:** Simpler to install and maintain in a utility corridor; quieter visual that lets the plantings dominate

### Optional Ideas
- Understory bulbs (fawn lily, trillium) for spring ephemeral interest
- Low bamboo water feature (shishi-odoshi) at east entry near boulder
- String lights along fence for evening ambiance

## Plants
- Vine Maple (Acer circinatum) — focal tree, center-west
- Salal (Gaultheria shallon) ×3 — along fence
- Sword Fern (Polystichum munitum) ×3 — scattered understory
- Oregon Oxalis (Oxalis oregana) ×mass — groundcover carpet
- Red Huckleberry (Vaccinium parvifolium) — east end accent
- Deer Fern (Blechnum spicant) — near vine maple
