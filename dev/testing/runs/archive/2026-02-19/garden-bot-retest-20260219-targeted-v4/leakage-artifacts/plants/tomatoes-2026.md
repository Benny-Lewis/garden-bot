# Tomatoes — 2026

## Location
- Backyard raised bed

## Status
- **Issue diagnosed 2026-02-19:** Early blight (*Alternaria solani*)
- Symptoms: yellow lower leaves with dark brown concentric-ring ("target") spots, progressing upward
- Contributing factors: overhead evening watering, cool wet weather

## Treatment Plan
1. Remove all infected leaves + foliage within 12" of soil (bag & trash)
2. Switch to morning base watering — no overhead evening irrigation
3. Mulch bed 2–3" straw/bark to prevent soil splash
4. Apply fixed copper fungicide every 7–10 days (and after rain)
5. Prune suckers, maintain airflow
6. Monitor weekly for new spots; remove promptly

## Next Season Notes
- Rotate: no tomatoes/peppers/potatoes in this bed for 2 years
- Consider early-blight-tolerant varieties: 'Mountain Magic', 'Juliet', 'Iron Lady', 'Defiant'
