Both options are open in Chrome. Here's how they compare:

---

### Option A: Moss Garden Path (Japanese-forward)

**Character:** Contemplative, curated, architectural. Reads as a Japanese-influenced passage garden (roji).

- **Path:** 3' stepping stone path in decomposed granite along the south/house edge — generous clearance, deliberate pacing
- **Groundcover:** Native sheet moss carpet (*Eurhynchium oreganum*) — the signature material, evokes temple gardens
- **Focal tree:** Vine maple (center-west) — provides canopy and dappled light the moss needs
- **Hardscape:** Three-boulder grouping at center — classic odd-number rock arrangement as a meditation point
- **Understory:** Sword ferns along the fence (5 total), deer fern near boulders, inside-out flower (*Vancouveria hexandra*) near the maple

**Tradeoffs:**
- (+) Strongest Japanese identity — moss carpet is the star
- (+) More open, spacious feel despite narrow corridor
- (+) Boulders add year-round structure with zero maintenance
- (-) Moss needs consistent moisture — may need summer irrigation in dry spells
- (-) Decomposed granite path needs occasional raking/topping

---

### Option B: Woodland Corridor (PNW-forward)

**Character:** Lush, naturalistic, immersive. Reads as walking through a native forest understory with restrained Japanese sensibility in the simplicity.

- **Path:** 2.5' pea gravel path along the south edge — functional, quieter feel
- **Groundcover:** Oregon oxalis (*Oxalis oregana*) carpet — native, self-spreading, clover-like texture
- **Focal tree:** Vine maple (center-west, slightly larger canopy emphasis)
- **Shrub layer:** Salal ×3 along the fence for evergreen screening, red huckleberry as an edible accent (ties into your stealth-edibles goal)
- **Understory:** Sword fern ×3 scattered, deer fern accent, single boulder at east entry

**Tradeoffs:**
- (+) Denser, more layered — fills in quickly and looks established sooner
- (+) Oxalis is more forgiving than moss — handles drier stretches better
- (+) Red huckleberry adds an edible element consistent with your front yard philosophy
- (-) Less distinctly "Japanese" — the Japanese influence is in the restraint/simplicity, not the materials
- (-) Salal can spread aggressively — needs occasional editing along the path edge

**My lean:** Option A gives you the strongest expression of your stated goal — when you say "Japanese influence," the moss-and-stone vocabulary delivers that immediately. Option B is the safer, lusher choice if you want the side yard to feel like a natural extension of your front yard's PNW native palette.

Which direction appeals, or do you want to mix elements (e.g., Option A's stepping stones with Option B's plant density)?
