`? Insight -------------------------------------`
Your profile shows Portland, OR (Zone 8b) — it's mid-February, so these tomatoes must be seedlings started indoors. The "concentric ring" pattern on lower leaves is a strong visual clue, but the growing conditions matter a lot for narrowing it down.
`-------------------------------------------------`

I can see you're in Portland (8b), and since it's February, these are likely indoor-started seedlings. The symptoms you describe — yellowing lower leaves with dark brown concentric ring spots — point toward a couple of possibilities, but I need a few details before I can give you a confident diagnosis:

1. **Where are they growing?** Indoor seed-starting setup (grow lights, heat mat)? Windowsill? Greenhouse?
2. **Container and soil?** Seed-starting mix, potting soil, cell trays, pots?
3. **Watering?** How often, and do the containers have drainage? Are the trays sitting in water?
4. **How old are the seedlings?** How many true leaves?
5. **Anything new recently?** Fertilizer, moved to a different spot, temperature changes?

**Waiting for your answers before diagnosing** — the concentric ring pattern is suggestive, but watering habits and airflow can make or break the ID.

Saved: none — gathering diagnostic context before recommendations
