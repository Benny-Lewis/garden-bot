`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Stealth edible harvest calendar for this design:**
- **March–April:** Rosemary + thyme available year-round (established plants)
- **June:** Serviceberry berries, first blueberries, artichoke buds
- **July–August:** Peak blueberry harvest
- **September–October:** Huckleberry harvest
- **Year-round:** Bay laurel leaves for cooking

That's 7 months of harvesting from a yard that looks like a modern landscape design to anyone walking by.
