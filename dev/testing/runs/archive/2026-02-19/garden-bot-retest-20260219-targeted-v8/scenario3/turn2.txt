## Option A — Naturalistic PNW Layers

Layered planting that mimics a PNW woodland edge: tall → mid → ground.

| Zone | Plants | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| Foundation (2 ft) | Kinnikinnick + creeping thyme, oregano | Native groundcover + stealth herbs |
| Left back row | 4 evergreen huckleberry | Reads as boxwood hedge — edible berries |
| Left mid | Sword fern + salal | Evergreen native texture year-round |
| Left accent | Vine maple (multi-stem) | Native canopy structure, fall color |
| Left front | Wild strawberry groundcover | Native + edible living mulch |
| Right back | 2 Oregon grape + 1 serviceberry | Native structure + edible berries |
| Right mid | Deer fern + heuchera | Native shade-tolerant texture |
| Right front | Blue fescue mass | No-mow native grass carpet |
| Strip (5 ft) | 2 serviceberries + sedge + camas | Native trees + spring bulb display |

**Pros:** Richest ecological value, most edible species (7), strong four-season interest, lower material cost (no gravel)
**Cons:** Softer/less structured look, vine maple needs occasional pruning, more organic feel may not read "modern"

## Option B — Structured Modern Native

Geometric blocks of native and edible plants with gravel mulch for a contemporary, tidy look.

| Zone | Plants | Why |
|------|--------|-----|
| Foundation (2 ft) | Gravel + low Oregon grape + rosemary/thyme | Clean edge, native + stealth herbs |
| Left block 1 | 4 blueberries in hedge form | Reads as formal boxwood — edible |
| Left block 2 | Karl Foerster grass | Vertical architecture, year-round |
| Left block 3 | Yarrow + native aster | Pollinator block, seasonal color |
| Left ground | Gravel + creeping thyme in gaps | Stealth edible, minimal maintenance |
| Right block 1 | 4 evergreen huckleberry hedge | Native + edible, formal form |
| Right block 2 | Bay laurel standard + artichoke (2) | Culinary tree + sculptural edible |
| Right ground | Gravel + sedum | Low-water, clean look |
| Strip (5 ft) | Gravel + 1 serviceberry + bunch grass | Minimal, clean, native |

**Pros:** Lowest maintenance, strongest year-round structure, cleanest curb appeal, most "modern" read
**Cons:** Fewer edible species (5), gravel adds material cost (~$200-400), less ecological layering

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Stealth edible strategy at work:** Both designs hide food production in plain sight. Neighbors see hedges, groundcovers, and specimen trees — you see blueberries, huckleberries, serviceberries, thyme, oregano, and strawberries. The key technique is choosing edibles whose ornamental form matches a conventional landscape role (hedge, groundcover, accent tree).

**Questions to refine your choice:**
- Which layout appeals more — the **layered naturalistic (A)** or **geometric modern (B)** — or a hybrid?
- Do you have a preference between blueberries (Option B left) vs. huckleberries (Option A left) for the main hedge?
- For the planting strip: 2 serviceberries (A) for more canopy, or 1 (B) for a cleaner look?
