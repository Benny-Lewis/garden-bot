Good — I found your existing garden profile and tomato records. Here's what I know so far:

- **Location:** Portland, OR (Zone 8b), clay loam soil
- **Tomatoes:** 12 mixed slicer seedlings in the south raised bed (backyard)
- **Transplanted:** Feb 18, just 3 days ago (started indoors before that)
- **Calendar note from Feb 20:** "Check tomato seedling moisture and airflow"

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
Your symptoms — yellow lower leaves + dark brown concentric (target-shaped) spots — are a strong initial match for **early blight** (*Alternaria solani*). But the skill requires I gather a bit more context before confirming, because transplant shock, nutrient deficiency, and other fungal issues can look similar early on.

Before I give a diagnosis, I need a few more details:

1. **Watering** — How often and how are you watering (overhead sprinkler, drip, hand-watering at soil level)?
2. **Timing** — Did you notice the spots before or after transplanting on Feb 18? Or did they develop in the last day or two?
3. **Mulch/soil contact** — Is there mulch around the seedlings, or are the lower leaves touching bare soil?
4. **Airflow/spacing** — How far apart are the 12 seedlings, and is there any cover (cold frame, row cover)?

**Waiting for your answers before giving a diagnosis.**
