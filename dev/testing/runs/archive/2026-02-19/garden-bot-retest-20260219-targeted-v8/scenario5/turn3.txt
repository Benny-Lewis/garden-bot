`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
The Zen Corridor design works well in this 8-ft width because it uses a single straight axis (the DG path) rather than curves, which would feel cramped. The two focal endpoints — living (maple) and mineral (tsukubai) — give the corridor a sense of journey despite being only 24 ft long. This is a core Japanese garden principle: *miegakure* (hide and reveal), adapted here as destination framing in a linear space.
