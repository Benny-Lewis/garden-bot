Great — you've got a solid profile already. Portland Zone 8b, south-facing, 30×15 ft of mostly lawn with clay soil. That's a fantastic canvas for an edible curb-appeal design.

`? Insight -------------------------------------`
**South-facing + Portland 8b** is prime real estate for edibles — long mild seasons, great sun exposure, and enough winter chill for fruit. The main challenge is **clay soil**: it holds moisture well (good for some plants) but needs amending for anything that wants drainage (herbs, blueberries). Raised or mounded beds solve this without replacing all the soil.
`-------------------------------------------------`

Since this is preference-driven, here are **two layout options** with different aesthetics. Both assume a ~4ft walkway running center from sidewalk to front door.

## Option A: Cottage Edible Garden

Soft curves, layered plantings, informal charm. Edibles are woven throughout so the whole yard is productive.

```
                        HOUSE (30 ft)
  ==================================================
  |                                                |
  |  .--Fig tree--.      .------Blueberry hedge----|
  |  | (dwarf)    |      | (3 bushes, mounded)    |
  |  *............*      *.........................|
  |     Artichoke    |    |    Rhubarb + Sage      |
  |   + Lavender     |WALK|   + Ornamental grass   |
  |     + Thyme      | 4ft|    + Echinacea         |
  |  *............*  |    |  *....................* |
  |  | Low herbs  |  |    |  | Creeping thyme    | |
  |  | (border)   |  |    |  | (border)          | |
  ==================================================
            SIDEWALK (30 ft)
          N <-- faces South (sun from top)

  Legend:
  *...*  = curved bed edge
  |    | = walkway
  ===    = sidewalk / house edge
```

**Key features:**
- **Dwarf fig** (e.g. 'Little Miss Figgy') — architectural focal point, great in clay, produces fruit Aug–Oct
- **Blueberry hedge** (3 bushes in mounded acidic mix) — spring flowers, fall color, summer fruit
- **Artichoke** — dramatic silvery foliage doubles as an ornamental showpiece
- **Low herb border** (thyme, oregano, sage) — fragrant, evergreen, spills over bed edges
- **Ornamental accents** — lavender, echinacea, and a grass for movement and winter interest

## Option B: Modern Edible Landscape

Clean lines, structured beds, more lawn/negative space. Edibles are concentrated in defined zones for a tidy look.

```
                        HOUSE (30 ft)
  ==================================================
  |  +----------+        +----------+              |
  |  | Herbs &  |        | Rosemary |              |
  |  | Greens   |        | + Sage   |              |
  |  | (raised) |        | (raised) |              |
  |  +----------+   |    +----------+   Serviceberry|
  |                  |WALK               (tree)     |
  |  +-----------+   | 4ft  +-----------+     *     |
  |  | Blueberry |   |      | Artichoke |    /|\   |
  |  | row (3)   |   |      | + Allium  |   / | \  |
  |  +-----------+   |      +-----------+           |
  ==================================================
            SIDEWALK (30 ft)
          N <-- faces South (sun from top)

  Legend:
  +---+  = rectangular raised/mounded bed
  |    | = walkway
  *      = tree
  ===    = sidewalk / house edge
```

**Key features:**
- **Serviceberry tree** — native, white spring blooms, edible berries, fall color. A Portland classic.
- **Raised rectangular beds** — clean geometry, solves clay drainage, easy to maintain
- **Herb & greens bed** near the door — convenient harvesting of lettuce, kale, herbs
- **Blueberry row** — structured hedge feel with seasonal interest
- **Artichoke + allium bed** — ornamental edibles with architectural form
- **More open lawn/ground** between beds — neat, modern feel

## Tradeoffs

| | **A: Cottage** | **B: Modern** |
|---|---|---|
| **Curb appeal style** | Lush, layered, colorful | Clean, structured, minimal |
| **Maintenance** | Medium — pruning, weeding curved beds | Lower — defined beds, less edge work |
| **Edible yield** | Spread throughout, more variety | Concentrated, easier to harvest |
| **Clay soil approach** | Mounded blueberries, rest adapted to clay | Raised beds solve drainage broadly |
| **Cost to install** | Lower — mostly in-ground planting | Higher — raised bed materials |

Which direction appeals to you — **A (cottage), B (modern)**, or a mix of elements from both? I can also adjust specific plants or features before we finalize.
