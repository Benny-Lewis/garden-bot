Option A (Cottage Edible Garden) is saved. Here's what I created/updated:

`? Insight -------------------------------------`
**Why these edibles work for curb appeal:** The key to edible landscaping in a front yard is choosing plants that look ornamental first. Artichoke reads as a dramatic silver perennial, blueberries look like any flowering hedge, and a dwarf fig has the architectural presence of any ornamental small tree. Neighbors see a beautiful cottage garden — you see dinner.
