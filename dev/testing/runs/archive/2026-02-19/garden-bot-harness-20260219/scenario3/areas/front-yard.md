### Zone Summary

- **West bed (left):** Dwarf fig tree ('Little Miss Figgy') as the focal point near the house, underplanted with artichoke for dramatic silvery foliage, lavender for fragrance and pollinator appeal, and creeping thyme as a low border along the walkway and sidewalk edge. Curved bed edges create an informal cottage feel.
- **East bed (right):** Three blueberry bushes in a mounded acidic soil mix form a hedge near the house — spring flowers, summer fruit, fall color. Lower plantings include rhubarb, sage, ornamental grass for movement, and echinacea for summer blooms. Creeping thyme borders the walkway edge.
- **Walkway:** 4 ft wide, centered, kept clear per constraints. Herb borders on both sides add fragrance when brushed in passing.

### Key Decisions

- **Dwarf fig over a standard fruit tree** — stays compact (4-6 ft), produces fruit Aug-Oct, thrives in clay soil, and provides an architectural focal point without overwhelming the 15 ft depth.
- **Blueberries in mounded beds** — clay soil and Portland's neutral-to-slightly-acidic pH need amendment; mounding acidic mix on top avoids full soil replacement while giving the bushes good drainage and the right pH.
- **Artichoke as ornamental edible** — the dramatic silver-green foliage reads as purely ornamental to passersby while producing edible flower buds. Perfect curb-appeal disguise for a food plant.
- **Curved beds, not raised** — keeps the cottage aesthetic; raised rectangles would look too structured for this style. Mounding is used only for the blueberries where soil amendment is needed.
- **Herb borders along walkway** — creeping thyme and low herbs release fragrance when stepped near, creating a sensory experience on the walk to the front door.
