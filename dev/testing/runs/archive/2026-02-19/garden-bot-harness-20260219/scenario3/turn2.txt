I presented two options — which one would you like me to save?

- **Option A** (Cottage Edible) — curved beds, dwarf fig focal point, edibles woven throughout
- **Option B** (Modern Edible) — rectangular raised beds, serviceberry tree, clean lines

Or should I save both options in the area file so you can decide later?
