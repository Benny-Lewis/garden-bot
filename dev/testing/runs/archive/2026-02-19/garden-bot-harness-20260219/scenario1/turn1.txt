`? Insight -------------------------------------`
**Why the conversation before file creation?** The garden profile skill deliberately delays creating files until we understand your situation. A zone and yard dimensions are a start, but soil type, goals, and irrigation drastically change what advice is useful. Portland's zone 8b is especially nuanced — the Willamette Valley has wet mild winters and dry summers, which is unusual for most US gardeners. That microclimate shapes everything from plant selection to watering strategy.
