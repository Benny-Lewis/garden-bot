- **Soil:** Clay, compacts easily
- **Current state:** Lawn
- **Drainage:** Not noted as problematic

## Goals
Low-maintenance curb appeal. Minimal ongoing upkeep.

## Notes
- South-facing full sun is ideal for drought-tolerant perennials and ornamental grasses common in PNW-friendly landscaping.
- Converting some lawn to planted beds would reduce mowing and add year-round interest.
