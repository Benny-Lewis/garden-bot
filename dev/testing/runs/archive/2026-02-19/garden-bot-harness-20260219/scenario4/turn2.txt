All saved. Here's what was updated:

- **`areas/backyard-south.md`** — new layout, zone summary, and key decisions reflecting the fire pit move and bed reduction
- **`areas/backyard.md`** — overview updated to match (fire pit east, 2 beds west/center)
- **`log/2026-02.md`** — revision logged

`? Insight -------------------------------------`
With only 2 beds instead of 4, you'll want to be more intentional about what goes in them — succession planting and interplanting can help you get close to the same yield from half the bed count. The freed-up space also gives you a more open feel between the growing area and the fire pit.
