### Zone Summary
- West/Center: Two raised beds for vegetables, bench near patio.
- East: Fire pit lounge zone.

### Key Decisions
- Moved fire pit from west to east side to separate it from the growing area.
- Reduced raised beds from 4 to 2 to open up space and simplify maintenance.
- Bench kept on west side near patio, close to the beds.

## Notes
- Ensure clear path from patio to fire pit and raised beds.
- Fire pit now on east side.
