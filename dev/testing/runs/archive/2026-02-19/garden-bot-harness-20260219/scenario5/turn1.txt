Let me ask these questions directly:

Before I draft a layout, I need to understand a few things about the space:

1. **How will you use this side yard?**
   - **View garden** — designed to be seen from a window or while passing through, no seating needed
   - **Destination** — somewhere to sit and linger, with a bench or stone seat
   - **Transition corridor** — functional path between front and back that should look good

2. **How do you feel about hardscape?** Dry creek beds, stepping stones, and stone basins (tsukubai) are signature Japanese elements.
   - **Go for it** — stone, gravel, stepping stones, a basin
   - **Minimal** — a few stepping stones or one focal stone, mostly planted
   - **Plants only** — skip hardscape entirely

3. **What's the east fence?** (type and approximate height — this affects how I layer the plantings against it)
