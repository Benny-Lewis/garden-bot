## Zone Summary

**North Entry (6 ft)** — Oceanspray and deer fern screen the fence and soften the corner. A single stepping stone marks the threshold into the garden room.

**Garden Room (12 ft)** — Vine maple set toward the east fence (asymmetric placement). Its canopy drapes over the stone seat below. Sword fern masses create lush understory. A feature stone anchors the north side, partially buried.

**South Entry (6 ft)** — Low Oregon grape for evergreen structure. Red flowering currant screens the fence with early spring blooms. Stepping stone marks the exit.

## Key Decisions

- **All-native plant palette** — Japanese influence comes from arrangement (asymmetry, layered canopy, moss groundplane), not imported species. Keeps ecological function intact.
- **Vine maple over Japanese maple** — Native analog with the same multi-stem grace, fall color, and dappled shade. Better adapted, no irrigation needed once established.
- **Minimal hardscape** — Two stepping stones, one feature stone, one boulder seat. Enough for structure and function without dominating the planting.
- **Fence screening via natives** — Oceanspray (north) and red flowering currant (south) will grow to 8-12' and obscure the 4' chain link within 2-3 seasons.
- **Destination seating** — Flat-topped boulder under the vine maple canopy, facing back into the garden room.

## Plants

- Vine maple (Acer circinatum) — specimen tree, garden room
- Sword fern (Polystichum munitum) — understory mass, all zones
- Deer fern (Blechnum spicant) — accent, north entry
- Oceanspray (Holodiscus discolor) — fence screen, north
- Red flowering currant (Ribes sanguineum) — fence screen, south
- Low Oregon grape (Mahonia nervosa) — low structure, south entry
- Kinnikinnick (Arctostaphylos uva-ursi) — groundcover, all zones
- Native moss — groundcover, shade areas

## Hardscape

- 2 stepping stones — natural basalt, ~18" diameter, flush with grade
- 1 feature stone — asymmetric, partially buried, 2-3' visible
- 1 stone seat — flat-topped boulder, ~18" high, compacted gravel base
