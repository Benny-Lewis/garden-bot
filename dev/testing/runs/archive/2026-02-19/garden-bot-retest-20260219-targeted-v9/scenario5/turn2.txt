Both previews should be open in Chrome. Here's the comparison:

---

## Option A — Stroll Path

A **movement-focused** design that makes the 24 ft corridor feel like a woodland trail.

| Zone | What | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| East entry | Vine maple + sword fern grove | Creates a "threshold" moment — you step into shade canopy |
| North border | Oregon grape → deer fern → salal | Layered native shrubs soften the fence, no pruning needed |
| Center path | Irregular stepping stones in moss | Meandering line adds perceived length; Japanese *tobi-ishi* pattern |
| Mid-corridor | Asymmetric stone grouping | Japanese accent — draws the eye off the path axis |
| West exit | Red huckleberry + sword fern | Seasonal interest (berries, fall color) frames the exit |
| Ground plane | Moss, bunchberry, wild ginger | Low-maintenance, shade-loving native carpet |

**Pros:** Maximum "forest walk" feel. Every foot of the corridor is usable passage. Very low maintenance — no hardscape installation beyond placing stones.

**Cons:** No pause/seating spot. Less formal Japanese character. Stepping stones in moss can be slippery in Portland rain.

## Option B — Contemplation Garden

A **destination-focused** design that divides the corridor into an entry screen, a dry gravel viewing garden, and a shaded seating alcove.

| Zone | What | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| East entry | Tall Oregon grape screen + sword fern | "Hide and reveal" — blocks view of gravel garden from entry |
| South edge | 2.5 ft gravel path (clear passage) | Guaranteed pass-through circulation along the south side |
| Center | Raked gravel panel + stone triad + tsukubai | Japanese *karesansui* (dry garden) adapted to PNW scale |
| Center accents | Moss mounds in gravel | PNW native texture meets Japanese composition |
| West-center | Vine maple canopy + stone bench | Destination pause point — sit and view the gravel garden |
| West exit | Salal, deer fern, wild ginger | Native understory frames the exit |

**Pros:** Strongest Japanese identity (dry garden + tsukubai + stone bench). Creates a genuine "room" in the corridor. Tsukubai attracts birds. Stone bench gives a reason to linger.

**Cons:** Raked gravel needs occasional re-raking (leaf debris). Tsukubai needs periodic filling/cleaning. Slightly higher install cost (gravel, basin, bench).

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
**Key design tradeoff**: Option A prioritizes the *journey* — every step is the experience. Option B prioritizes the *destination* — the dry garden is a scene to view from the bench. Both use the same native plant palette (vine maple, sword fern, Oregon grape, salal, deer fern, wild ginger), but arrange them for fundamentally different purposes. In a narrow corridor, this choice of movement vs. pause defines the character of the space.

Which direction resonates more? Or would you like elements combined (e.g., the stroll path with a tsukubai added)?
