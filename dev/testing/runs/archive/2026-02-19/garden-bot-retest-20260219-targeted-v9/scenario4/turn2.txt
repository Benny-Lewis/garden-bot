**Preview-then-commit workflow**: The skill enforces a two-phase save — preview SVGs use `-option-a`/`-option-b` suffixes and are never written to the canonical `-layout.svg` path until approved. This prevents accidental overwrites of a working design during iteration. After approval, preview files get cleaned up so the `areas/` folder stays tidy.

**Append-only log discipline**: The log file only gets new entries appended — previous entries are never edited or reordered. This preserves a reliable audit trail of design decisions over time.

Design saved. Here's what was updated:

- **Layout SVG** — fire pit moved to east, 2 beds on west, seating centered near patio
- **Area file** — zone summary and key decisions updated to reflect the swap
- **Log** — recorded the revision with date
- **Calendar** — added March tasks for physically moving the fire pit and relocating the beds

Saved: areas/backyard-south-layout.svg, areas/backyard-south.md, log/2026-02.md, calendar.md
