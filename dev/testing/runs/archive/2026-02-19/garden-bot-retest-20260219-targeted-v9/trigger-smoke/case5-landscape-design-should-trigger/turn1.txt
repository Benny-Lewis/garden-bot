## Option A: Cottage Garden

A lush, romantic design that maximizes flowers and color throughout the seasons.

| Zone | Plants | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| **Mixed Perennial Bed** (NW) | Lavender, Salvia, Echinacea, Catmint, Geranium | Year-round color and pollinator habitat |
| **Rose Garden** (NE, expanded) | Existing roses + David Austin, with Nepeta & Alchemilla | Preserves your roses and adds companions that suppress leaf spot |
| **Low Border** (SW) | Boxwood edging, Heuchera, seasonal annuals | Clean street-facing edge with swappable color |
| **Cottage Mix** (SE) | Peonies, Foxglove, Delphiniums, Hollyhocks, Sweet peas | Tall, dramatic cottage backdrop |

## Option B: Modern PNW Native

A lower-maintenance, ecologically focused design using Pacific Northwest natives with clean geometry.

|------|--------|---------|
| **Native Shrub Bed** (NW) | Oregon grape, Red huckleberry, Kinnikinnick | Evergreen structure, wildlife food |
| **Native Meadow Strip** (W-center) | Festuca, Camas, Yarrow | Seasonal wildflower interest, no-mow |

## Tradeoffs

| Factor | Option A: Cottage | Option B: Modern Native |
|--------|-------------------|------------------------|
| **Maintenance** | Higher — deadheading, seasonal replanting, more watering | Lower — natives are adapted to Portland climate |
| **Water use** | Moderate — perennials need summer irrigation | Low — natives + rain garden reduce irrigation needs |
| **Curb appeal** | Lush, colorful, traditional charm | Clean, contemporary, "Portland natural" aesthetic |
| **Wildlife** | Good pollinator support | Excellent — full native food web |
| **Clay soil fit** | OK with amendments | Excellent — natives thrive in clay loam |
| **Cost** | Moderate — many perennial varieties | Lower plant cost, but flagstone + boulders add hardscape cost |

`? Insight -------------------------------------`
The rain garden in Option B is particularly well-suited to your clay loam — clay's slow drainage causes runoff, and a bioswale captures that water and lets it infiltrate gradually. In Portland's rainy winters, this can meaningfully reduce erosion and standing water near the walkway.
