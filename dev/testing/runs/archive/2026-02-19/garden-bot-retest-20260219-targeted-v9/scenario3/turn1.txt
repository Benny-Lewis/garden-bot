I've opened both layouts in Chrome. Here's a comparison:

---

## Option A — Cottage Edible

A lush, informal feel with **maximum edible diversity** and reduced lawn.

| Zone | Plants | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| Mixed Bed A (left, near house) | 3 blueberry bushes as hedge, lavender + rosemary border, thyme groundcover | Productive hedge + aromatic border |
| Mixed Bed B (right, near house) | Dwarf apple tree (focal point), strawberry underplanting | Four-season interest + fruit |
| Pollinator Strip (left, street side) | Echinacea, salvia, bee balm, oregano edge | Color + pollinators for edibles |
| Herb Border (right, street side) | Sage, chives, parsley, low boxwood edge | Tidy edible border |

**Tradeoffs:** More edibles, more seasonal color, but more maintenance. Less lawn remaining. Cottage style may read as "busier" from the street.

---

## Option B — Modern Edible

Clean lines and structured forms with **fewer but higher-impact edibles** and more lawn retained.

| Zone | Plants | Purpose |
|------|--------|---------|
| Left bed (near house) | Espaliered fig trained flat, alpine strawberry underplanting | Dramatic focal point + fruit |
| Right bed (near house) | Columnar pear + cherry, rosemary hedge in front | Vertical fruit that stays narrow |
| Left border (street) | Clipped lavender + sage hedge | Formal, fragrant, edible |
| Right border (street) | Karl Foerster grass + blue fescue | Year-round structure + movement |

**Tradeoffs:** Lower maintenance, cleaner curb appeal, but fewer edible varieties. More lawn kept. The espaliered fig is a strong statement piece but takes a season to train.

`★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────`
- **Espaliered fruit trees** (Option B) are a classic trick for combining edibles with formal curb appeal — they look architectural, not agricultural. In Zone 8b Portland, figs are excellent candidates since they thrive against south-facing walls.
- **Blueberries as hedge** (Option A) work beautifully in Portland's acidic soil — they give spring flowers, summer fruit, and brilliant red fall foliage, tripling their curb-appeal value.

**Which direction appeals to you — A (cottage, max edibles), B (modern, cleaner lines), or a mix of elements from both?** I can also adjust specific zones if you like parts of each.
