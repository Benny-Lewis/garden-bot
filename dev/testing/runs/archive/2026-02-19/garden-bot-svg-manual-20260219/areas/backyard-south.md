### Zone Summary

- **Seating area (NW, 12×8 ft):** Generous gathering space directly off the patio — fits a table + 4 chairs. Positioned in the NW to stay close to the house while leaving the sun-drenched south edge for growing.
- **Raised Bed A (SW-center, 6×4 ft):** Small bed west of the main path, next to the compost bin for easy soil amendment. Good for herbs or a compact crop rotation.
- **Raised Bed B (S-center to SE, 18×4 ft):** Primary production bed along the south edge, east of the path. Full southern exposure — ideal for tomatoes, peppers, and other heat-lovers in Zone 8b.
- **Raised Bed C (E side, 4×10 ft):** Vertical bed along the east edge. Catches morning sun. Good for greens, root crops, or trellised climbers.
- **Compost bin (SW corner, 4×4 ft):** Adjacent to beds for easy amendment. Moved from NE to SW to keep the patio entrance clear and place compost closest to where it's used.
- **Circulation:** 3 ft N-S path from patio to south edge + E-W connector between compost/seating and beds. Full loop, no dead ends.
- **Open center:** Flex space / lawn between seating and east bed.

### Key Decisions

- **Compost in SW (not NE):** Prioritizes proximity to beds over proximity to kitchen. Keeps the patio-to-garden entrance uncluttered.
- **Split south bed at path crossing:** Improves access — every bed reachable from at least two sides without stretching more than 2 ft.
- **L-shaped bed arrangement:** Maximizes southern and eastern sun exposure while preserving a generous seating area and open center.
- **Total growing space:** ~136 sq ft across 3 beds.
