# Testing Runs Retention

Runtime run artifacts remain under `dev/testing/runs/`.

## Live Runs

Keep these run folders in-place for current gate evidence:

- `dev/testing/runs/2026-02-19/garden-bot-retest-20260219-full-v1`
- `dev/testing/runs/2026-02-19/garden-bot-retest-20260219-targeted-v10`

## Archived Runs

Superseded run folders are moved under:

- `dev/testing/runs/archive/2026-02-19/`

This preserves evidence while reducing noise in the live run directory.
