  Welcome to Opus 4.6

❯ I planted three blueberry bushes (Duke variety) along the fence in my     
  side yard last Saturday. The soil there is                                
     slightly acidic which they should love. Can you record that in my      
  garden records?                                                           

● I'll use the garden profile skill to record your blueberry planting.

● Let me check if you already have a garden profile set up, then record your
  blueberry planting.

● Great, you already have a garden profile. Let me read your existing data to
  see what's there.

● You have a profile set up for Portland (Zone 8b) with front and back yard
  areas, but no side yard yet and no plant files. I'll create the supporting
  files for your blueberry planting. Let me check if there's a February log
  already.

● Read 2 files (ctrl+o to expand)

● Now I have the full picture. I'll create the side yard area file, the
  blueberry plant file, update the profile, and append to the log — all at once.

  ★ Insight ─────────────────────────────────────
  - Duke is a great pick for Portland. It's a northern highbush variety that
  needs 800–1,000 chill hours, and Portland typically delivers 800–1,200. Your
  zone 8b is well within its hardiness range (zones 4–7 are typical, but 8b
  works fine).
  - Your acidic soil is a real advantage. Blueberries want pH 4.5–5.5, which is
  more acidic than most garden plants tolerate. Portland's native clay soils
  often land in the 5.5–6.5 range, so you may already be in the sweet spot or
  close to it — a soil test would confirm.
  - Consider a pollination partner. Duke self-pollinates reasonably well, but
  planting a second variety (like Bluecrop or Patriot) nearby can noticeably
  boost your yields.
