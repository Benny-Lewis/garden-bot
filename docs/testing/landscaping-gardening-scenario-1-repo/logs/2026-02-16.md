# Garden Log — 2026-02-16

## Setup

- Created garden tracking system
- Defined three zones:
  - **Zone A**: Front yard (~800 ft², full sun, south-facing)
  - **Zone B**: Backyard south half (~1000 ft², part sun)
  - **Zone C**: Backyard north half (~1000 ft², shade under oak)

## To Do (Getting Started)

- [ ] Walk the property and photograph each zone
- [ ] Identify any existing plants
- [ ] Get a soil test kit (OSU Extension offers affordable testing)
- [ ] Assess current irrigation / hose bib locations
- [ ] Check oak tree health — consider arborist consultation
- [ ] Measure exact dimensions of beds / plantable areas
