## Notes

- **Protect the oak**: avoid grading, compacting soil, or changing drainage near the root zone
- The drip line extends roughly as far as the canopy — roots extend even further
- Good candidates: sword fern, western red columbine, wild ginger, hostas, heuchera, astilbe
- Native woodland understory plants will thrive here with minimal maintenance
- Oak leaf mulch is free and excellent — let leaves decompose in place where possible
